1,Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout,"""2019 vintage. Pours a very dark brown color with noticeable sugars coating the glass. Lots of coffee and maple in the nose, not much barrel or heat at all. Very rich and coating mouthfeel with a lot of layers in the flavor. Coffee, espresso, maple, vanilla are in good balance. Not much bourbon or oak if at all noticeable. Really great beer as it's very hard to pull off this many flavors and layers without a dominant flavor. Just missed it a little with not much bourbon or barrel presence aside from the vanilla notes.""",4.53
2,Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout,"""It's hyped... There is a lot of breweries doing this style of beer right. For this to be the top rated is kinda nuts... Over rated, over hyped, over priced.

3,Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout,"""Reviewing 2019 vintage. This pours thick and close to black with unsurprisingly poor head retention (that being said, I drank this out of a taster glass). Does not stop the nose from jumping out of the glass. Huge coffee and maple, as advertised, masking any potential aroma from the barrel. That trend continues into the taste - difficult to find the barrel even when looking intently for it. The coffee is very pleasant and plays well with the maple, which presents authentically and not as a general sweetness. Thick, smooth mouthfeel (again, no surprises here). Overall, this would receiving a rating bump if it wasn't meant to be a barrel aged beer. In that respect, it falls short, as the adjuncts and texture are the real star of the show here. Very cool to try, but not worth the price of admission these days.""",4.52

22,Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout,"'its always an occasion to drink what is deemed on this website to be the best beer in the world. regardless of what one may think about how such rankings are figured, it is a treat to say the least. i remember when i was heady and westy 12 before that, times have changed! after a couple of narrowly missed opportunities to drink this one over the years, my man drlovemd87 came through in the clutch with this rarest of the rare bottle. my pour is as thick as paste, slick and black like crude oil, and without hardly any head to it, near still in appearance, shiny, almost gelatinous looking. the aroma and flavor are intense but unfortunately (to me) familiar, i wanted this to be strikingly different, at least from a quality standpoint, and as good as it all is, its not head and shoulders above all else, it might not even be my favorite barrel aged coffee stout i have had this year (shhh). a few things are immediately obvious to me. the first is that whatever barrels these were, they seem to have housed some excellent whiskey. its not more or less of it, nothing about the oak profile specifically, but the bourbon character itself seems obviously better than most of what else is out there, this i will grant. the second thing, is that saying something like this is objectively better than something else in its category that is notable and near perfect and all of that, is highly problematic, approximations and cloudy memories and nothing more than opinion. factually, this isnt that much better than any number of great beers in its field, and i will stand by that. i cant spend the whole time drinking this thinking about the merits of a ratings system i dont control or other beers i like better though, that would be a foolishly wasted opportunity to enjoy quite literally the best. its full of rich bourbon, heavy vanilla and maple syrup qualities, even the texture of maple syrup, tons of barrel char and earthy burnt dark grain and chocolate, and a well integrated high end coffee profile as well, in some ways quite simple, but impossibly mature and nuanced, enhanced magically by the whiskey, and with lingering sweet, bitter, raisin, cocoa, and bourbon character. its as good as they say it is, that is not my comment. my comment is that others are at this level too. i am enormously thankful to have been able to drink this one, especially without having to pay the absurd secondary market prices this is fetching. if you are considering dropping some coin for this on a forum or whatever, i would reconsider, not that this isnt awesome, but its likely that your local bottle shop or brewery has something comparable...'",4.55

The lacing was more spotty than I would have liked, but it still lingering for a long time and if it had been more sheet-like I would have given an even higher rating for this beer's look. Smells absolutely incredible - tough to imagine another imperial stout with better aromas than this one. Dark, rich chocolate fudge, dark roast coffee, an incredible vanilla aroma, caramel, malt, brown sugar and a touch of roasted nuttiness. Good hit of oak and bourbon at the beginning and end. Taste follows the nose almost perfectly - no reduction in the complexity, depth or balance of the flavor notes. The vanilla was better than any vanilla aromas or notes I'd ever previously experienced in an imperial stout. Crisp, bright and fragrant, I could drink stouts infused with that vanilla any day of the week. Smooth, rich, slightly thick and creamy mouthfeel and the perfect amount of carbonation. Decent amount of warming alcohol even when the beer was cold. Definitely a sipper. Pairs well with savory food - doesn't have to go with sweeter dessert like some other imperial stouts.

Two fingers of bone white head slowly recede to a dense collar, with a halo of lacing around it. Tons of micro-bubbles can be seen rising up the sides of the glass, despite the beer's turbid complexion."", '', ""Nose: Similar to Green in the sense that the Galaxy presence is quite clear, lending huge overripe stone fruit notes - peach and apricot, yes, but I'm actually getting a fair bit of nectarine here. Just loads of ripe, perhaps even slightly UNripe nectarine. The massive dry hop dank peppery note still lies beneath, just like Green. The big difference between the aroma of this and Green, is that Very Green leans way fruitier. There's an absolute blast of ripe tangy pineapple and juicy acidity, as well as quite the dose of tangerine juice. This beer is so intensely hopped that there's almost a minty, camphoraceous note to it, like squeezing a fresh, sticky hop cone. Pungent and full of terpenes. Very Green."", '', ""Palate: First sip, and the beer absolutely bombards the palate with an explosion of Galaxy hops. A category 5 hurricane whirlwind of aggressive dankness and serious resins. A 5 alarm fire in the paper district, tastebuds up in smoke. Quickdraw McNally ten paces back from the crooked lawman, and Quickdraw didn't get his name by playin' fair. On the count of three, he draws on two, and puts a 16 ounce, 8.3 calibre Very Green slug right between the eyes of the lawman, sending him down with an oily, resinous, bitter thud. Aggressive and boisterous, the onslaught of earthy, peppery, piquant Galaxy hops deliver what I suppose are classic Galaxy notes, but turned up to 13. There's that musty, dank, way too ripe apricot, peach, and nectarine, and well as some bright acidid pineapple, but then a tsunami of earthy, green resins just flood the palate bringing some sharp black pepper and then the most saturated resinous bitterness I've tasted. It's bitter, don't be fooled, but it isn't the bitterness that stands out, but rather how insanely sense and saturated the hop delivery is. It's almost too concentrated to find any quieter notes. This is not a quiet beer. It's loud, bold, and entirely in your face. That bitterness peaks early, washing out the fruity pineapple, and turning into pure, raw Galaxy hops, which just linger on and on and on, with firm resins, clingy oils, and looking bitterness slowly escorting it away."", '', ""Mouthfeel/Body: Just like Green, it's big and soft, like a teddy bear. A teddy bear that can rip your face off with an explosion of hops, but it's still big and soft. The softness of Green always stuck out to me. The sheer aggression of the hops sort of lend a rawness to that fluffy body (as well as a rawness to the roof of your mouth!), but the amount of resinous hop oils make up for a lot of that. Effervescence is absolutely perfect, and even a bit lively given the nature and weight of the beer. Oils just cling all over the mouth and accumulate with every sip."", '', ""Overall: This is an intense beer. Everything about it is intense. Its towering presence, its reputation, its hop bombardment of biblical proportions, its dense saturation, its firm, aggressive delivery...It is a serious beer, and anyone who fails to see why this is such a sought-after beer just hasnt had enough IPAs. This does everything it can to stand out and be recognised, and that's what's needed to for an IPA to have a fighting chance in today's world. This beer established itself on reputation and quality, and it lives up to both, and still manages to surprise.""",4.51

Above all, this particular bottle was a gift from the very person who introduced me to beer. It is a gesture that I took his invitation to heart, and have faithfully pursued the hobby well after we parted to different parts of the globe. And it is a mark of my respect for his patience in enduring my initial skepticism, callousness and thick-headedness when it came to drinking beer and taking notes. I owe him a great debt, and I honor that debt by drinking his beer.', '', 'I took great care and attached great ceremony to reviewing the Westvleteren. Ambient noise and smells were minimized.

It kicks up a light brown head, little to no lacing, and aside from a few flecks of yeast in the last droplets to fall from the bottle’s mouth, I have no physical evidence that this beer will be a milestone in my beer drinking career. That evidence appears in the aroma. I am stricken with childhood memories of happy Colorado Christmases, as an intoxicating blend of vanilla, oak, ribeye steaks, fig, and a touch of chocolate fill my nose. It is incredible, and it is here that I first get a taste of what all the praise, writing and hype is about. The Westy isn’t hype at all. It is credibly amazing, and deservedly loved. And the taste fits the Quad. style I’ve come to love so much. It is big and rich, barreling onto the tongue with the same aromatic flavors that caused me to reel in my chair. A few seconds later this boldness attenuates, exposing an undercurrent of fig and a deep, sweet red wine flavor. And then again, moments later this layer of flavor recedes to expose a tertiary layer of molasses, oak, smoked wood and a parmesan cheese like umami. To be short, there are three distinct layers of flavors, each of them characteristically delicious, and each a little quieter than the last. That final touch of umami savoriness is practically a whisper, but you can still make out the words.', '', 'With all these flavors in a single beer there is a very real threat that the flavors may become crowded and muddled. This is not the case. The Westvleteren 12 delivers these flavors in stages, and on a perfect palate. The beer is thick, but not syrupy, and it textures the flavors without warping them. It is a crowd of luminaries, each in perfect concordance with the others, a kind of harmony of brilliance without egos to interfere.', '', 'By the very end of the beer I am questioning whether this is actually a Quadrupel. It has all the basic qualities of a Belgian Strong Ale according to my taste buds, and possibly according to a rigid style guide. But I think the Belgian Strong Ale tag might be slightly too tight on a beer like this. The Westvletren is an expression of a style, and a permutation so fantastically brewed that it almost breaks from tradition. These breaks are sometimes called revolutions, which would be the highest form of irony for the Westy’s brewers who are steeped in tradition themselves. But they are also steeped in this beer, and they must know that what they do, they do very well. This level of brewing is intentional, and it shows. One need only look at the lines of avid drinkers banging on the monastery’s doors to understand that there must be some authentic draw to this beer. And now I finally realize it through a few intense sips. I’ve extended a dimension of my understanding of beer and the craft beer world with one bottle of a highly-esteemed brew.

To try any Westvleteren is a rite of passage. I have been visiting Westvleteren Abbey since the late eighties. Back then, you turned up on spec, no appointment or reservation needed, and loaded up. 10 crates was the max. If you are lucky, you can get two crates now. Or a take out pack of six, or two, from the cafe opposite the monastery gates. This is what hype has done. But also, has not. This beer is the same now as I remember it >30 years ago. No succumbing to fad or fashion. Now, a further, but very important point. Listen to the monks! Westvleteren is made to age. It really does get more surreal with months, even years on it, if stored cool. Yesterday I cracked open a bottle from my stash brewed in January 2019. For me, it has cream and ginger characteristics, and they were really getting a hold here and singing. For you - well, you decide. Even the taste evolution from the February release was interesting. Its texture, too, is like no other. You don't just taste it - you hear it. So. Drinking Westveleteren 12 (and 8 and 6 for that matter) is a ceremony.

I’m not going to straight up say that I don’t like pastry stouts because of all the hype and attention they receive, because I myself am guilty of buying into beers and brands that receive hype and attention and actually enjoying them every once in a while, but it’s probably because one of the things I value most about beer is that it’s proletariat and ubiquitous in nature; if I like a beer, I want to be able to reach out into my fridge and grab another one, or run to the store and buy another without feeling like I could have done better things with my money—the reason why I value mouthfeel so much in a beer is because I personally believe that correlates most strongly into how repeatable a beer is no matter how flavorful or unique tasting a brew should be, I normally won’t want to try another unless there’s some sense of balance or leveling factor that clears my palate for the next sip.', '', 'Given my totally made-up standards and personal values stated above, pastry stouts couldn’t stand any further from brews that I would normally be willing to pay an amount of money or stand in line for. I’m pretty sure this comment will come back to bite me in the ass when I find myself standing in line for BA Double Stack next month, but I digress.', '', 'Some (actual) preliminary thoughts about this beer. Apparently German Chocolate Cake doesn’t really come from Germany, and despite its name, its main highlight is whipped cream and the coconut-pecan frosting that’s used to fill the cake. On a more relevant note, this beer is best summed up by contrasting it to the beloved Street Fighter ZERO character Hibiki Dan.', '', 'So for those of you that aren’t millennials or were living under a rock when Street Fighter, Dan’s character was created as a parody of SNK’s King of Fighters franchise characters Ryo and Robert, who very suspiciously resembled Street Fighter’s two most recognizable characters, Ryu and Ken. Outside of having twisted mannerisms and catchphrases suspiciously resembling the two SNK characters that were ripping off Capcom characters that he was ripping off, Dan is kind of memorable for being all show and no power whatsoever; his super/EX combo finish, Shinkū Gadōken, for example, looks awfully similar to Ryū’s Shinkū Hadōken while doing 1/40th of the damage it does—many-a-times have I sat in front of the TV screen, thinking “oh shit I’m fucked” when I saw the screen suddenly turn red, orange, and yellow while CPU Dan caught me off guard with my HP at 30%, only to realize my character was still alive after being hit by ostentatious super combo.', '', 'Labored metaphors aside, BAIGCC is similar to Dan’s super finish in that it packs all the flavors it purports to deliver in one ginormous, sugar-spice-and-everything-nice upside your head, but then presenting a rapidly drying finish, which makes you feel stupid for cringing and bracing for impact—it’s hard to explain in close detail, but it’s like the opposite of getting a penicillin shot at the doctor’s, where you don’t feel the needle going in, but it feels like somebody injected the meaty part of your butt cheek with peanut butter for the rest of the day.', '⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀', 'A vacuum wave motion fist of toasted coconuts, wild sugar cane, rum cake, baker’s chocolate, intense caramelized sugar hits you square in the noggin, followed by a frosting-like sweetness. There’s a slight hint of hazelnuts that follow the gargantuan sweet super attack before all the flavors just simply drop off the side of the earth. Save for some residual flavors of hazelnuts and powdered sugar, your pixelated character brushes off the blow as if nothing happened and gets up ready to fight again—the fight against the glass is one of attrition after that initial “surprise”', '⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀', 'The mouthfeel is initially thick and sticky like raw cake batter, but it morphs into a more tolerable moist-ish soft texture with subsequent sips. The only way carbonation could make any impact on this beer is if it were effervescent to the level of a brut champagne; the intense brick wall of mouthfeel counteracts against any fleeting semblance of carbon dioxide on the tongue.'",4.45

The taste is very rich as well with chocolate being the main flavor, but the coffee becomes more apparent as it warms. Once the beer reaches a room temperature the vanilla and Bourbon and a woody like taste come through very clearly. The beer feels like a thick sludge consistency-- almost like Hershey's syrup being added to a beer, but not in a bad way. The high alcohol content is not apparent when it is cooler, but I'd recommend having it just below room temp to really enjoy it as it becomes very boozy and Bourbony at room temp and greater. Overall it's a truly fantastic beer.""",4.67

This is a tasty beer but hard work due to the thick body and high abv. As one who's no fan of spirits this took a while to finish.

This beer requires sips about 1/4 the normal size. Then you can really experience it without having your senses being overloaded by the intensity. But consider that this is 3x the alcohol of a light beer, so there's really no hurry.

Quite possibly one of the best NE-style IPAs I've ever had - very close to Tree House's Green, and a bit better than Heady Topper. Found this online, can date 7/17/19 so wanted to try it as soon as possible to sample it fresh. Juicy, refreshing, soft, hazy, everything I was looking for in a NE-style IPA - and my expectations were sky-high for this beer, as they are for any Tree House IPA. Looks absolutely incredible - orange-yellow hazy quite opaque color, a little white fluffy head and some nice spotty lingering lacing. More lacing would have bumped up the look rating to 4.75. Smells great, loads of fruity tropical hops - mango, passion fruit, tangerine, pineapple, grapefruit, lemon, maybe a touch of papaya. Definitely tropical and ripe fruit. Also some more balanced malt, vanilla, bread, and then some floral and grassy hop notes at the end. Dankness was muted and well-restrained. Taste follows the nose, again with a good balanced hit of both the bitter hops and sweeter malt backbone. Dankness at the finish was very well-received. The mouthfeel of these world-class NE IPAs is just ridiculous - soft, juicy, slightly sticky, coats the palate, smooth and creamy. Perfect amount of carbonation. The higher ABV was very well hidden and these ones are just so dangerous to drink as the alcohol will creep up on you. I could drink these all days and if they distributed anywhere in this region (Midwest) I'd find them and buy 6-packs galore.""",4.68

The flavour is a bit more muddled, but the cinnamon remains huge, from the beginning to the end, contributing that cinnamon toasted crunch up front intermingling with the DL base, and combining well with the spicy rye barrel to bring more of a spice component on the backend. Peppercorns aren't as prominent as in 2017, which is a good thing. Mouthfeel is full bodied, good carbonation, smooth and slightly silky, cinnamon spice on the finish.

1347,Aaron,"'a near perfect example of an english barleywine, this one aged two years in bourbon barrels and also bottle conditioned. its the saisons and wild beers that get all the attention from these guys, but this is as good as anything else in the game in this style, and seems gentler, more subtle, and more mature and drinkable than other over the top, barrel heavy offerings with lots of residual sugar, firestone walker comes to mind there, this is just a wonderful cold weather sipper, and honestly the essence of the style as far as i am concerned, big thanks to my buddy for sharing this one (among many others), in an epic session over the weekend, i have been wanting to try this forever. this has a deep matte mahogany color to it, a tall tan head creamy and thick, and no visible sediment at all, looks well cleaned up and mature. the aroma is rich barley malt, some sweet long boiled and toffee character to it, chestnut, maple, and toasted bread. its immediately not that sweet, full of earthiness, and enormously layered. the bourbon has some vanilla and honey notes going on, but doesnt interfere with the base beer, it enhances, sweet oak in the mix as well, raisin, and fig. the flavor is amazing, really about the barley malt, very enlgish to me, no hops at all, maybe some maris otter in here with some darker crystal, definitely a concentrated richness to it without decadent sweetness weighing it down, and the booziness is minimal for the style, although this is a bit lower anyway, i like it not being a focal point in the taste. the bourbon and oak are smooth and not too forward, and there is a wonderful depth and body to this, better and better as it warms too. the perfect balance of all the elements here, some yeast character through most of it, and a curiously clean finish for the style. near perfection here, no frills barleywine as it should be. a wonderful drinking experience!'",4.55

This was one of my biggest wants because I figured Hill Farmstead does everything else great, I bet they would nail a Barleywine as well. Oh, and it is barrel aged for like an eon. Aaron pours a dark brown. Not necessarily clear bodied behind the tint of the beer. A thin, defeated ring of diminutive bubbles rest steadily around the outer conversion of beer and glass; the only thing minute about this beer. The aroma rises out of the glass like a slothful perfume. Thick, damp whiffs of bourbon, raisins, toffee, and dessert wine. Detailed, rich, royal. The flavor marches in line with the nose. Heavy, sweet, and decadent. I think the older batch has a bit more complexity but lacks the barrel character of it's newer kin. I get some flavors of boozy dates and maple syrup from both, though. Of course the feel stands abreast with the other elements of the beer. Portly, heavy, and warming. Toothsome but intense. Definitely lived up to the hype I personally gave this beer.

That’s likely due to its availability where I live but this is an ale to savor and enjoy. The color is an orange hue with tight effervescence. Maybe it’s the magic of lupulin - all the power packed aspects of the resin in hops - that transform this IPA but it’s working. Gushing with tropical piney aroma and just indescribable hop and malt balance on the palate. I’d say most of the complexity is in the nose and that’s fine because you don’t need much more than the lupulin hoppy flavor profile that already delivers. Finish is gorgeous.',4.6

I had a taste of another bottle in December, and it immediately reminded me of BCBS, but with some difference in character. It had a more pronounced dark fruit flavor. After 8 months of cold storage, I finally tried my bottle, and it immediately grabbed me with its strong, mellow flavors, and its similarity to BCBS. I now find it better than BCBS, as it seems to have stronger flavors. Beautiful dark, sweet flavors of raisins and plums, along with strong bourbon and barrel flavors, plus a good dose of alcohol. Label says it ""contains alcohol"". No kidding.', '', ""Tastes very much of alcohol, perhaps too much for some people, but I like it in small amounts. Takes 3 days of dedicated effort to finish a bottle. I'm about half way through this one after 2 days. Seems to last quite well with fridge storage after opening, no doubt due to high ABV.

1616,Black Tuesday,"""Well, lets just do it. Pouring a 2016 bottle from a 750 ml. into a tulip glass. This beer poured surprisingly lighter in color than most of similar style. It had medium brown highlights throughout the whole pour. Forms in the glass dark, but even still with highlights around all edges. It formed a very thin and incomplete crown that was light tan in color. The smell is hot and boozy with big dark fruit notes like raisins, plums and figs. The taste comes in with those dark fruit notes again but now providing some cherry like element as well. It is definitely warm, but less than would ever be expected from a 40 proof bourbon barrel aged imperial stout. Finishes with that warmness mixing with some nice chocolate notes. Honestly though, I'm a little let down on the amount of flavor being delivered. Overall, this wasn't bad but I've definitely had better from the Bruery. I will give them the achievement of making a 40 proof stout that is drinkable as hell and the ABV that hidden tho.""",3.99

Aroma mellows as the beer warms, providing a kaleidoscope of dark stout flavors, with the alcohol receding into the background. Flavor profile is roasted, toasted, and caramel malts quickly followed by toffee, molasses, and bourbon. There is a boozy, heavy burn at the back fresh out of the fridge, but as it warms the bourbon turns to more of a warm liquid, as opposed to a molten express delivery of alcohol. The dense flavor profile covers up the near 20% ABV well, but the booze still peeks through, even after aging for a little over a year. Mouth feel is thick with a velvety, grainy texture.

There just isn't any bitterness or intensely pithy, resinous bite to cut through that sweetness. It's barleywine sweet, and not IPA bitter.

Very balanced with an ultra sweet middle, mild funk, and clean dry finish. Not really vinous in flavor, more grapeish. Feel is light and effervescent. Overall this beer scares you when you take a whiff but it unexpectedly lives up to the hype in the flavor which has no bearing to the smell. There is a little bit of wine in the nose but approaches more grape.'",4.22

Pours lightly hazy ruby reddish orange/pink/purple color with a 1-2 finger fairly dense and fluffy light pink head with good retention, that reduces to a thin ring of lace that lingers. Light spotty lacing clings on the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of big tart plum, apricot, cherry, raspberry, strawberry, cranberry, red grape, fruit skin, lemon, lime, green apple, grapefruit, hay, straw, grass, cork, wood, wheat, and cracker; with lighter notes of leathery/musty funk, vanilla, red wine vinegar, and yeast/oak earthiness. Damn nice aromas with great balance of complexity of fruity/funky/fairly acidic yeast, red grapes, pale malt, and oak barrel notes; with great strength.

Great complexity, robustness, and balance of fruity/funky/fairly acidic yeast, red grapes, pale malt, and oak barrel flavors; with an awesome malt/tartness balance, and zero puckering flavors after the finish. Light-moderate increasing dryness from tartness and tangy/tannic fruit/oak. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, moderately bready/grainy, fairly crisp, and acidic/tangy/tannic balanced mouthfeel that is great. Zero warming alcohol for 7%. Overall this is an excellent fruit lambic. All around great complexity, robustness, and balance of fruity/funky/fairly acidic yeast, red grapes, pale malt, and oak barrel flavors; very smooth, crisp, and refreshing to drink with the modestly lactic/tangy/tannic/drying finish. Well rounded Brett complexity and solid Lacto presence. Perfectly balanced between grapes, oak, and malts. Was expecting way more out of this. Not as much depth in funky complexity, and not as jammy/vinous on fruit character as I wanted. A very enjoyable offering, and spot on style example otherwise.'",4

Sure, this packed a punch but it was so smooth and sweet that it was like the softest boxing gloves were put on before the blow was delivered.

It’s beast strength, however just having had some of ‘19’s Goose Island BBA stout yesterday (at just a bit less ABV), I can say this is more of a dangerous dessert beer because it isn’t as thick and sticky sweet...but make no mistake it is sweet enough because of balance. It’s medium-medium-thin for the style but it’s working. Coconut and a nutty chocolate aspect that I wish would be used more in these beer types. You’ll hear “walnut fudge” to describe this, and that’s very accurate. And the coffee I mentioned as not being obvious, it has delicious hints that appear as it warms. Some tobacco too.

There are some baking spice notes of cinnamon and nutmeg, before those dark fruit notes slowly fade, letting some dark chocolate, coffee and cream, and a huge malty nutty note emerge.

I think age has actually smoothed this out a bit -cooling off the heat and smoothing out the bite. It's a fantastic barleywine with some darker malts in it, and while it's a bit of a dark fruit bomb, it really does have some nuance and subtly, and it's well worth seeking out to try - even at 6 years old.""",4.45

Grilled nuts, cocoa, molasses to at times more American oak dill accents. Clean attack, gets funkier towards the finish and retronasally.

I’m never sure what to think about this bruiser. I admit I find it rather delicious and actually crave it from time to time, but it’s questionable at best as an imperial stout, and as a bourbon barrel aged imperial stout, I often wonder where the stout went.

Viscous mouth feel, I didn't discern the peppers until the third sip, and then they didn't leave.

At 10%, I\'d like some more heft to my beers, whether it be carbonation or weight or something to just coat the mouth and do the intensity of flavor justice. Again, it seems they were going for creating the most ""drinkable"" TIPA, as I have had fuller takes on the style from them (DDH AGE, for one).

Despite its ABV, it\'s not as extreme as their earlier attempts, avoiding all of the pitfalls of palate fatigue and ""imbalance"" (ugh) that they struggled with in the past. It\'s big and bold and hopped out the wazoo, but it feels tighter and more carefully considered in the details.

Some slow effervescence can be seen."", '', ""Nose: There are average cherry wild ales, and there are cherry wild ales that you can just tell are something incredible by the aroma. This is in the latter category. The amount of cherry on the nose is borderline unreal and saturated, while being entirely organic in nature. Not only is this a cherry bomb aroma, but what is really impressive is how both the Montmorency AND the Balaton cherries seem to translate. There is some intensely sweet, ripe, juicy Balaton character, lending an almost maraschino cherry on top of a maraschino liqueur note, bursting with big, deep, dark cherry juice, while the Montmorency cherries lend that floral, fresh, tangy cherry note, with a touch of stem, pit, and even cherry blossom. There is also a healthy amount of oak, and, along with the cherries, seems to lend this subtle cinnamon spice note, with just a whisper of oaky vanillins. There is a suggestion of acidity, but it doesn't singe the nose when inhaling, and there's very little earthy or barnyard funk. Just some wet oak, leather, old parchment, dusty attic, and a hint of brett. The cherries obscure any real serious funk or acidity that may lie beneath. There's a touch of gently toasty grain beneath everything, which is the icing on the cake."", '', ""Palate: First thing, from the very first sip, it isn't bracing sourness that hits, it isn't tannic oak, it isn't malt, it's sweet and tart ripe cherry flesh. The deep, bold Balaton sweetness greets the palate, giving up its sweet juicy goodness, while never coming across as artificial, cough syrupy, sticky, or overly sweet. This sweet cherry juice flavour unfurls to eventually reveal the Montmorency character beneath. The Montmorency is not quite as deep, bold, and saturated with juicy sweetness, but it provides a slightly less ripe, slightly fruitier character, that brings Japanese cherry blossom, a bit of plum, a hint of cherry potpourri, cinnamon/amburana wood spice, and a bright, natural, almost slightly unripe cherry tartness to the table. In addition to this subtle fruity tartness, the acidity lends a near-perfect degree of sour. It really isn't bracing, puckering, or blinding in any way. Make no mistake, this is a sour ale, no question about it, but it isn't Midwest sour. There is some lemony lacto pucker, a bit less of some acetic pedio bite, and a bit more of some tart, funky, mineralic brett, lending not quite salinity, and definitely not sweat, but that classic restrained brett tang, along with some musty wet wood, a little hint of bandaid, and that classic bretty stone fruit pit note. The high degree of minerality paired with the bandaid note and the deep cherry really gives this a little hint of a Kriek vibe. The tartness has a quick downward curve, allowing some really wonderful oak to appear before the finish, paired with a hint of vanilla, a hint of baking spice, a hint of caramel, and a hint of brown sugar. The sourness takes a far back seat, revealing some more dusty brett, and then finally, the ever-so-slightly sweet toasted grain base reveals itself, with a wonderful melding of grainy wheat and round malty barley, cereal grains, essence of cherry, and gently tannic oak linger on and conclude the finish."", '', ""Mouthfeel/Body: MvB is light, crisp, and snappy by nature, though the mild to moderate cherry sweetness and slight bit of malt body push this a bit closer to medium-bodied territory. Effervescence is surprisingly low. It isn't flat, but rather lazy and slow. One might expect this to be a super fizzy, champagne-like experience, but that is not the case, which also contributes to a slightly fuller feel. Soft, round, and even quite juicy upfront, the ale is not scrubbing, and even feels somewhat smooth. The oak in the finish provides some tannicdrying as the sweetness fades, but the ale itself isn't tannic or ultra-dry."", '', 'Overall: This is a really remarkable cherry wild ale, and an absolute triumph from Jester King. The perceivable differences between the Montmorency and Balaton cherries is a work of art, and the structure, balance, and progression of the ale is nothing short of impressive. The acidity is forward, but kept in check, the sweetness makes a statement up front, and then takes a supporting role, the oak and microflora influence walks a tightrope right down the middle of balanced, and the subtle malty, grainy base beneath it all is something that I always look for, but rarely get in highly acidic ales.

This beer pours out just like the others, way lighter than beers similar in the style. Brown in color with highlights all the way through. The smell is warming bourbon with a mocha backdrop. Raisins and plums evident as well. The taste comes in with that same burning sensation and provides dark fruit notes. A very nice chocolately finish. There is some coffee and mocha presence in there, but for the main part it's slight and if not advertised, I think most would just think of a bourbon barrel aged stout. The mouthfeel is thick, chewy and great for the style. Overall, this has probably been my favorite of these so far. But still nothing blowing me out of the water. I guess I'll just keep swimming.""",4.24

Damn nice aromas with great balance and complexity of dark/roasted malt, coffee, and bourbon barrel notes; with great strength. Mild increasing booze in the aromas as it warms, but not overwhelming. Taste of huge nutty dark roasted coffee, milk/dark chocolate, cocoa, caramel, toffee, vanilla, cream, fudge, brown sugar, maple syrup, almond, bourbon, toasted oak, and dark bread; with lighter notes of coconut, marshmallow, molasses, licorice, smoke, dark fruit, pepper, and roast/oak earthiness.

Incredible complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/roasted malt, coffee, and bourbon barrel flavors; with a great roasted bitter/sweet and bourbon/oak spiciness balance; with zero cloying sweetness after the finish. Lightly increasing dryness from bourbon/oak spiciness and roast bitterness. Medium carbonation and very full body; with a smooth, creamy/silky, and lightly slick/sticky/chalky/tannic balanced mouthfeel that is great. Lightly increasing warmth of 19.9%, with mild lingering barrel booziness after the finish. Overall this is a fantastic barrel aged imperial stout! All around outstanding complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/roasted malt, coffee, and bourbon barrel flavors; very smooth and dangerously easy to sip on slowly for the huge ABV. Bruery stouts always seem to have a class of their own on the flavor profile. Not as deeply roasty or charred on black/roasted malts like some others; but still extremely rich and complex. Outstanding barrel integration and balance; without feeling overly boozy, tannic, or drying. Very similar to the base beer with big levels of fruity/nutty coffee complexity.

There’s a nice bourbon and barrel edge that charges through first, then, once that brute force element dies away, there are some nice smoky notes that integrate well with the roasted malt. Not really burnt, coffee or chocolate dominated, the delicate balance is pretty remarkable. The barrel does stand out but not in a way that dominates. I’d have to say the smell is my favorite part of this beer.', '', 'The taste is also all about depth and complexity. The barrel has again taken the lead, but the honey in the base beer makes this very unique and adds some flower and compliments the sweet chocolate notes very well. The hint of smoke and char allows this to again tip back towards balance, as the beer really straddles the line between sweet and bitter, boozy and balanced. A warming alcohol note towards the end is a bit out of place, but at 10% this beer has a ton of flavors and is certainly not a booze bomb. A touch more integration and slightly different flavor profile would make this score higher from me. I guess I like beers with a touch more personality or that lean one way or another. This does a great job encapsulating many elements, but the tradeoff is less personality. Not overrated per say, but also not my favorite of the mega-whales I’ve been fortunate enough to try.', '', 'The mouthfeel is just a bit thin compared to the biggest, baddest stouts out there.

Thanks again bro.', '', 'From a 25cl bottle bottle into a snifter', 'Vintage: 2009', 'Drunk directly after a 2008 base Stormaktsporter', '', 'APPEARANCE: A black pour, slightly darker than the base, makes a medium sized, medium-thick tan head that fades rather quickly. A wisp and bubbly ring are left behind. Jet black body and zero carbonation evident. A ring remains until the end and leaves some dots of lacing down the glass. Much the same as the base, though slightly darker pour.', '', 'SMELL: Roasted malts with plenty of bourbon for sure. Oak and vanilla play a role, as well as some hints of milk chocolate. Medium strength; not as bold as the base beer, but definitely strikes a superb balance between the roasted malt base and the barrel.', '', 'TASTE: Much more impressive than the nose, and this is where the beer makes a name for itself. Roasted malts up front with some milk chocolate and sweet molasses before the barrel kicks in. Bourbon, oak and vanilla show up in full force after the swallow, but it still leaves room for the roasted malt foundation of the base beer. Very well put together with a touch of heat after the swallow. Bold and lingering aftertaste of roasted malts, molasses, and the bourbon barrel all work together very well. Great stuff, with just the right amount of heat at the swallow.', '', 'PALATE: Same as the base beer. Medium body and carbonation, and very creamy smooth on the palate. Goes down smooth with a touch of heat and an alcohol bite at the swallow. Finishes slightly mouth-coating. Nice and creamy for sure.', '', 'OVERALL: Again, these 25cl bottles are just unfair, especially when split up. They need to start filling 750s and sending them to my house. One of the most balanced and flavorful bourbon barrel aged stouts on the planet. Nothing dominates, allowing the great roasted base beer to combine beautifully with the barrels. A touchstone in the style. Whether this is better than the base Stormaktsporter is really moot point, as one is world class stout, and the other is a world class barrel aged stout. Drink them both if you get the chance. Thanks again for this opportunity Doops.'",4.5

Pours an opaque pale orange/yellow color (like white grapefruit juice) with a pretty aggressive head with decent retention. Scents of sweet tropical punch and candy. I’ve been on a hazy DIPA kick this summer, so a lot of them blend together but this one definitely has some unique notes coming through. The description by Trillium says pink starburst, and I’m definitely getting some of that- really candy like fruity flavor. I’m also getting some bitter citrus and sweet tropical fruits. Lingering bitterness from hop oils on the palate. I have to say this one sneaks up on you at 9+% because you don’t even notice it. So many beers at that level have a very obvious alcohol burn and taste but this one is totally smooth for that ABV. My first time trying heavy mettle (I’ve had one in the alloy series and death mettle) and I think this one is my fav of the bunch. May not be your bag if you don’t like the sweetness that this recipe invokes, but I’m definitely digging it.'",4.68

Lots of mango, some guava, pineapple, and a hint of papaya, with secondary notes of kiwifruit, strawberry, blueberry, coconut, lychee, peach, nectarine, and a remarkably sweet, exotic fruity element that I simply cannot place. The aroma is completely saturated, sweet, and fruity, and bears no earthy, musty, or funky components.', '', ""Palate: The beer greets the palate with a forceful, sugary sweetness, which is to be expected from a dry-hopped beer of this calibre. It isn't a starchy, malty sweetness, but rather a concentrated fructose sweetness, like ripe tropical fruit. Speaking of ripe tropical fruit, the flavour is bursting with ripe mango, pineapple, papaya, and overripe peach, the latter being very indicative of the Galaxy hops that are crammed into this. There are some bright, juicy, slightly acidic notes of orange juice and grapefruit, which highly compliment the pineapple notes, and also help to cut through some of the sweetness. Much of this acidity is presumably hop burn, though it's restrained enough to be enjoyable, adding a layer of complexity rather than being detrimental to the beer itself. There is just a touch of earthy dankness which is also to be expected from a bill containing any amount of Galaxy. I suspect the grist contains a measurable amount of oat, as the malt is clean, fairly neutral, and possesses practically zero graininess. The finish is quite fruity and floral, before the sweetness gently subsides, allowing just a touch of resinous bitterness to peek through at the very end, before lifting off, leaving a clean, oaty dryness and a whisper of peach lingering."", '', ""Mouthfeel/Body: It's a big, bold, dry hopped New England double IPA clocking in at 9.3% ABV, AND it's from Trillium. Anyone who has had a big Trillium IPA can imaging that this beer is just one massively fluffy hoppy pillow. The beer is soft, fluffy, creamy, and velvety smooth, yet still possesses enough effervescence to lend texture and cut through some of the heft. Nevertheless, this is a very stout beer, and is by no means a midday summer refresher. While the flavour profile would allow this to pair nicely with food, I think the sheer weight of it may prevent it from being the ideal mean accompaniment. Also bear in mind that aside from the heft of this beer, it shows little-to-no evidence of it's ABV, which could make this a dangerous little creeper."", '', ""Overall: For what this beer is, it's hard to find much, if anything wrong with it.

Citrus, pith, berries, mango, musky wine grapes, dank hemp, tropical fruit, wheat biscuit, sugared grapefruit. Absolutely phenomenal.

This is going to be interesting. Let's begin."", 'Upon greeting the palate, the ale carries a mild malt sweetness, with an absolute ton of maltiness. Fresh baked still soft dark bread, rum-soaked fruit cake, and cola emerge, peppered with dark spiced rum notes. An explosion of dark fruit reveals notes of prune, fermented cherry, dates, raisin, and fig. Along with these dark fruit notes comes a character I generally only find in red wine cask-aged ales - fruity, yet dry wine grape/red berry notes, with the typical fermented wine flair. This actually shifts along with the dark fruit notes to become fairly earthy, and extremely similar to the port note in a port cask-aged imperial stout. Some subtle European hop spice and earthiness pair up with this wine-like character, and the initial malt sweetness begins to fade to the background, followed closely behind by much of the dark fruit notes. Into the finish, it becomes earthy and spicy, with the earthiness coming primarily from hops, but some of that tawny port note still lingers. At this point - well into the finish - the flavour takes a turn, and it suddenly takes on the characteristics of a traditional German amber/dark lager. The caramelised bread notes, the subtle spicy hopes, and most of all, the yeast flavour takes on a lager-esqu flavour, complete with the very subtle metallic note. The cola, spice, sweetness, malt, dark fruit, and earthiness fade away, and the ale concludes with the aftertaste of European hops and a whisper of dark bread.', '', ""Mouthfeel/Body: The body is rather unique, because it's both rich and crisp at the same time. It greets the palate medium-bodied, with a very tight crispness about it. Soon after, the maltiness lends a big, soft, not-quite-chewy richness to it, pushing it close to full-bodied territory, but constantly remains balanced by a very lively fizzy effervescence. It's wet, soft, and even a bit slick upfront, but as it finishes, it dries out and becomes fairly crisp once again. There are stages where the ale is crisp, medium, and full-bodied, but it's a harmonious transition, and in the end, I would put this in the medium-bodied category. Slight acidity in the first half of the beer, which is slowly extinguished by the malt. Semi-dry finish with mild drying properties, and some slight hop resin cling. Becomes sticky around the lips. Very mild alcohol warmth from the back of the throat to below the sternum, from its 10% ABV, and fluid nature."", '', ""Overall: This is a truly fine example of nuance, and does not strike me an an ale that is easy to properly brew. There is a lot going on in here, but it's never loud or abrasive. It's soft, friendly, and comforting, offering a warm, gentle embrace, and a velvet caress. I've never had Westvleteren 12, but if it's truly significantly better than this, then that must be one spectacular beer. I hope someday to try it, but for now, this stands as the best Belgian quadruple I've had to-date.""",4.33

If you want a heavier, more complex, or otherwise more extreme beer, there are barleywines, imperial stouts, barrel-aged porters, and over-the-top IPAs to suit. This beer has the benefit of being a nigh perfect execution of the genre. It balances sweetness, malt, bitterness, mouthfeel, and that “skunkiness” of Northern/Central European beer to perfection. The result is a beer you can turn to regardless of mood or season with the assurance of enjoyment. It is the penultimate decathlete of suds.

A smooth mouthfeel and a sweetish finish produce a wonderfully crafted beer. Some have criticized the sweetness level, but I didn’t find it to be excessive. It’s a truly great dessert beer and one that’s on a par with another favorite of mine called Samoa This. And as it warms, it gets even more flavorful, making it a great choice for any Snow Birds in the Northeast who want to sip it in front of a roaring fire.

Beneath this sweet-tart balance are notes of lemon, apple, Bartlett pear, fresh grass, white grape, unripe berry, starfruit, fresh nectarine, white plum, a hint of phenolic black peppercorn, and dried orange peel. There is quite a bit of dusty brett, lending some light funk, wet wood, a gentle earthiness, fermenting stone fruit, and a gentle peach pit bitterness. There are subtle grassy floral notes from some very restrained hopping, which is greatly appreciated. The finish puts particular emphasis on these grassy floral notes, along with some dusty brett funk, and a gentle black pepper bite. The ale finishes beautifully dry, with zero lingering tartness, and a gentle, clean aftertaste of cracker saison grains, with the faintest whisper of tannic fruit pits.', '', 'Mouthfeel/Body: The ale is medium-light bodied. Crisp, refreshing, and ultra snappy with the malt providing just enough body to provide a subtle softness. Effervescence is lively and fine, without being scratchy or seltzery. Gentle acidity upfront providing a balanced tartness, concluding with just the perfect degree of tannic dryness. Highly attenuated.', '', ""Overall: This is maybe the perfect all-around saison. It is absolutely authentic and beautifully classic in nature, with the most balanced amount of acidity you could possibly get in an ale like this. Not puckering, but enough to just nudge this into sour ale territory. This is everything you could ask for in a saison. Authenticity, perfect grain balance, gentle tartness, excellent yeast complexity, Belgian influence, crisp, refreshing body... It's wonderful. You won't find the complexity of the heavy hitter sours in this, but if it's the perfect saison you're looking for, Bernice will take you there. Privileged to be able to drink this.""",4.41

Then the big let down came into play. The mouth drenching aftertaste of apple juice plagued my mouth. This is not a barreled apple brandy.

No. Is this the best beer I ever had ? No. I even doubt the 12% abv and would rate lower around 10%. I took no measurements though.

Bitter orange rind notes are most noticeable. good amount of bitter lingering... more than I expected. Finishes drier than I expected. There is a strong mineral character, an almost metallic tingle which, for me, takes over too much of the flavor.

Im maybe not as “citra-centric” as others so I shouldn’t be surprised that im not gaga over this. I see why people like it but... seems like a lot of hype surrounding this beer. My issue is that it starts exactly where it ends, it feels almost stingingly sharp with citrus... like your tongue is being zapped, but there isnt a depth to the experience... or a nuance to the hop profile...

OK, on to the flavor... more coffee, basic, but good, just like a regular cup of Joe black coffee... more maple syrup as expected, and kind of sweet... chocolate syrup... some vanilla... but I\'m still not finding the bacon. I wasn\'t really expecting bacon, but maybe some apple smoked wood maltiness...? Or am I missing it? I get coffee, maple, toffee, almost burnt but not sugar, vanilla, medium to darker caramel, some background fruitiness, and a bit of ashen roastiness. Is it smoky? I don\'t think so, not really, there is some in the far away background but I wouldn\'t consider it smoky. Still, it\'s good. It\'s nice and rich without being overly so, and sweetish but not too sweet although some of that maple sugar does linger on the palate. It\'s not really a dessert beer though, or is it? It could certainly be used as an ingredient in a dessert but it is rich enough to be a dessert beer on its own? Ahhh, maybe. So, OK, what else? Medium bodied and gently crisp then smooth.', '', 'Review# 6,436'",4.25

Very good smell but I'm not getting too much from the nose in the way of the regular bomb! So we'll see what the tastes brings.

I wish the coffee and vanilla were showing up a little more as well, but I do have to say that this is greatly balanced as far as the whiskey and barrel being present but not overpowering. The mouthfeel is thick and fudge like. It coats the mouth all the way through while providing a slight and well balanced warming sensation. Overall, this was a very good treat and I'm glad to have another crack at it. But it's pretty much what I remember from the first time. It's very good, but not great.

I’ve been wanting to try a beer from this highly-lauded brewery for a long time and was finally able to find this one on Tavour. 2019 date printed on the bottle. Pours a very thick syrupy jet-black opaque color with some nice tan-mocha head and some very spotty lingering lacing. I wish that the lacing would have persisted longer, but I did really enjoy the appearance of the liquid itself. Smells incredible, deep dark roast coffee, dark chocolate, vanilla, caramel, brown sugar, malt, toasted nuts and a little cinnamon. I really couldn’t detect chili peppers in the aromas. Taste follows the nose, great balance, depth and complexity. At the finish there was a very mild note of chili peppers, although without any corresponding heat. This was a sipper of a beer, but the high ABV was still fairly well hidden and this paired well with both savory dinner and sweet dessert. Coffee was neither acidic nor sour, and was actually very well done considering other coffee stouts tend to go crazy on the coffee infusion. This one had just the right amount of reserve. Smooth, thick, syrupy, creamy mouthfeel that coated the palate. Just the right amount of carbonation. An excellent beer!'",4.55

5025,Coffee Abraxas,"'Pours black and after a very moderate intensity pour, nets near zero head. What head is there comes via a ring of khaki foam that lingers a long while. Aroma is huge, hitting all the notes of the base beer - cinnamon, cardamon, nutmeg, chilies and other spices. Dark chocolate and cocoa powder add a little dry sweetness. Medium-bodied, dark coffee is interwoven throughout the structure of the nose, never taking the limelight, instead subtly reminding the palate it\'s there. Roasty, toasty malts add firm and dark support, but are an afterthought to the additive flavors. Flavor profile is deep notes of mingling cardamon, nutmeg, ancho (mild) chilies and cinnamon with medium-bodied, dark coffee, and roasty malts up front. Medium-bodied coffee hits center stage for a brief glimpse between spices and malts, and then returns to lingering and observing from aside the curtain. While spices eagerly welcome each sip like a used car salesman do for a visitor to the lot, they quickly fade to show the frame work of this beer - roasty, toasty, nutty malts - in other words, robust and dark. Between the dynamics of spices, coffee, and malts, there are flashes of chocolate, cocoa powder, and molasses. Very dynamic despite a slightly heavy hand on the spices. Perhaps more so than any other beer I\'ve had, serving temperature is critical here. Too cold and the spices come off heavy, but as the beer warms a touch, the spices meld into the dark malt backdrop, forming a sublime experience. As this beer nears the 50F mark, it develops a sublime balance. Mouth feel is medium-thick, with a smooth, creamy texture that develops a fairly still texture when served directly out of the fridge. As the beer warms, it develops a more grainy, velvety texture, enhancing the experience. Overall, the headline here is ""ABRAXAS"", with the subtitle being ""enters a non-mutually exclusive relationship with coffee"". Coffee is present, particularly as the beer warms, but never steps into the limelight for more than a brief second or two. Due to the namesake of this beer ""Coffee Abraxas"", this is a slight disappointment, although it is still a dynamic, complex stout worthy of cozying up to on the coldest of nights.', '', 'Served in a 12oz snifter from a 750mL bottle.'",4.34

I’ve been squirrelling so much anticipation, ewe wouldn’t even believe, but bear with me - this is a massive milestone, let me crow about it [animal puns: success!]. 7 years ago I posted my first review on beeradvocate.com, and in that time I’ve had many many great beers, and in the last few years less and less crap beers. TBH I realised life is short there are too many beers out there for one man to drink (and review) so I’ve been sticking with the “good stuff”. Rodenbach Caractère Rouge: good stuff I’ve heard, plus I already love Rodenbach Grand Cru, seems like a no brainer.

5215,Clare's Thirsty Ale,"'been looking forward to trying this one for a long time and am stoked to have finally gotten the chance. this is a really neat and sort of unexpected beer, strange to name a strong barrel aged stout thirsty ale, like it implies easy drinking or high volume beer or something, but this is anything but, and it would take a special kind of thirst to want to drink a ton of this one. a rye whiskey barrel aged imperial stout with raspberries, and a wonderful one at that. i go back and forth on the fruited stouts, sometimes they get way too sweet and candy-like with the chocolate in the malt and the fruit sugars, but the raspberries are as tart as they are sweet in this, so while it has some residual sugar and raspberry jam qualities, its also really natural tasting, clean, and fairly acidic from their tartness. its amazing how forward the fruit is in such a dense strong dark beer. sure there is still plenty of dark malt in here, its intensely roasty with a coffee quality to it, and there is some barrel char and earthy wet wood as well, but the summery brightness of the berries lightens it all up and really defines this beer for me. rye is a smart choice for barrels too, its less sweet in this manifestation than bourbon would have been, and the dense slightly spicy rye character makes the grain base seem particularly interesting to me. light vanilla too, but it isnt desserty so much. dark cocoa, a little bitterness, and whiskey, along with old school raspberry jam in the finish, its just delicious and about as well done as something like this could be. this reminds me of an excellent raspberry stout i had from hardywood park a few years back but with the barrel, but other than that beer, quite original. worth the hype!'",4.34

The flavors are quite enjoyable, tart and fresh blackberry, juicy and jammy, red wine acidity, chewy oak, good funk, a little cheesy with a nice amount of mustiness, lemon zest cuts into the sourness a little, despite it's tart character, but offers some brightness and like the nose, lingering red grape and currants, fleshy and puckery. The mouthfeel is good, coating, zippy and lively with high carbonation levels, good dry tartness and an easy finish that has a crisp kick."", '', '', 'Verdict: A nice Wild Ale from Side Project, not overly sour, which I find to be a typical attribute with their fruited sours.

Mild grainy malt sweetness in the background, but make no mistake, the acidity and the blackberry are the stars here. Although, the blackberry is certainly playing second fiddle to the lacto and acetic acid. Flavour is surprisingly less sour than expected, e.g. La Fosse, and the blackberries kick in towards the end. For the most part, it's oak, a bit of hay, a lot of lactic and acetic acid contributing a strong sense of sourness. The blackberries start to come into their own halfway in, and leave you with a mild jammy flavour at the end. The tartness never recedes but is rather constant. Still, it's a tasty beer and is far easier to drink than La Fosse. Overall, a very nice blackberry wild, but it lacks a good bit of complexity for the most part. It's acidic with a moderate blackberry presence, that's pretty much all she wrote.""",4.24

Head is near null with only a bit of fizz rising to the top and disappearing - akin to a glass of Champagne.

Flavor profile continues the tart green apple and dry green grape story-line. Interwoven are notes of lemon zest, cellar stone, grapefruit and peach. Finish is lightly sour, with light-bodied, citrus sugary notes lingering long after the finish. Mouth feel is characterized by a moderately soft effervescence that only opens up after the initial sharp, energized effervescence decays. It has a medium, middle of the road, consistency. Overall, very unique. Lightbodied sourness mingles with dry green grapes and tart green apple to form a beer styled after champagne and white wine.', '', 'Served in a 15.5oz Speigalau tulip from a 375mL bottle.'",4.16

Additionally, I like that the malt comes through as I've been finding a lot of beers lately that only display the hops. On to the taste... I think the aroma sets it up real well. So, to repeat, I'm finding a nicely blended mix of firm malt that's gently biscuity and bready with notes of hop resins, soft citrus, peach, apple and sweet berries, and subtle mango. A very firm bitterness anchors it from start to finish, and then dries it quite readily. It finishes medium-long with the hoppy fruitiness fading first, followed by some residual malt, and then earthy and leafy/herbal hops the linger the longest. Bitterness then trails for even longer. It has a mouth coating medium-full body with a standard carbonation that gently bristles but then warms to become smoother wrapped in the malt that's there. Overall it's really quite nice.

Been slacking, but I figured Blueberry Flora was a good time to start up again.', '', '', 'Pours a radiant dark blush purple, gorgeous fizzy head tinged with color highlights of the brew itself. Head settles quickly and leaves a beer much in common with a Shiraz in appearance.', '', '', ""Aroma is big wine barrel presence, raspberry much in the framboise nature, blueberry jam, oak, and soft vanilla. Big, juicy, bright nose on this. Most barrel I've had in my nostrils from Hill Farmstead."", '', '', 'Taste reveals another beautifully balanced masterpiece by Shaun. The fruit is front and center giving way to dried blueberries, raspberry skin, grape sweetness, and some wine grape tannins. The woodsy oak and vanilla add depth while base flora flavors come through giving off some flower notes and a more tropical type of fruit vibe.', '', '', ""Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a lower carbonation level, and the lowest end I've encountered from the brewer. But there is enough to prickle the taste buds and help clean the fruity flavors away. Tart but not super sour much to my liking."", '', '', ""Overall a brilliant brew that has so much in common with fresh lambic krieks and framboise. Balance, raw fruit nature, subtle funk, and lovely oak properties to round out and perpetuate complexity. But the wine barrel elevates this to the level of Lou Pepes vs standard fruit lambics. Don't get me wrong, this is unique in every way possible and the lambic connection is really only meant to be taken with a grain of salt. It's the depth which makes me relate this to the fruited lambic realm. Highly recommended, will go down in the books as one of those memorable drinking experiences.""",4.74

Tart blueberries upfront with very mild white wine overtones, and a background of faint oak barrel, a very faint hint of beady yeast and funk. The finish has some mild acidic tartness to add...but it consistent with the initial flavors. The complexity really comes through as the beer warms. There is just the slightest hint of funk to it.', '', 'M- Very low carbonation, relatively flat. Body is medium weight and has a slightly acidic consistency and a slightly watery consistency.', '', 'O- Overall this is a very well done, complex beer. I have not had Florence but I am having trouble finding the base beer after the wine barrel aging and addition of blueberries. I really like this beer but before my rating the rating that this beer has is just about equal to a very famous belgian blueberry lambic. Although this is a nice complex beer- it is not really the cream of the crop.'",4.23
