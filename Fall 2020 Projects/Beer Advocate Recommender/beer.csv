0,Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout,"'2019 draft and bottle.', '', ""I didn't think this beer could possibly live up to the hype after the long wait to try it, but got-damn this beer is the real McCoy. Huge coffee nose, reminds me of walking into a (great) coffee shop. Chocolate, bourbon, subtle maple hiding in the background. Taste is simply perfection. Phenomenal coffee flavors, chocolate, bourbon, and a perfect maple finish. incredibly well balanced between coffee and maple. Thick, oily mouthfeel more on par with Sr-71 than assassin. What can I say, its phenomenal. Leaves you wanting more and more, but unfortunately not many oz's to go around.""",4.99

2,Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout,"""2019 vintage. Pours a very dark brown color with noticeable sugars coating the glass. Lots of coffee and maple in the nose, not much barrel or heat at all. Very rich and coating mouthfeel with a lot of layers in the flavor. Coffee, espresso, maple, vanilla are in good balance. Not much bourbon or oak if at all noticeable. Really great beer as it's very hard to pull off this many flavors and layers without a dominant flavor. Just missed it a little with not much bourbon or barrel presence aside from the vanilla notes.""",4.53
3,Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout,"""It's hyped... There is a lot of breweries doing this style of beer right. For this to be the top rated is kinda nuts... Over rated, over hyped, over priced.

The beer that my friends and I brewed is more balanced than this."", '', ""It's good... Just not msrp $100 and drive to middle of nowhere good.""",1.49
4,Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout,"""Reviewing 2019 vintage. This pours thick and close to black with unsurprisingly poor head retention (that being said, I drank this out of a taster glass). Does not stop the nose from jumping out of the glass. Huge coffee and maple, as advertised, masking any potential aroma from the barrel. That trend continues into the taste - difficult to find the barrel even when looking intently for it. The coffee is very pleasant and plays well with the maple, which presents authentically and not as a general sweetness. Thick, smooth mouthfeel (again, no surprises here). Overall, this would receiving a rating bump if it wasn't meant to be a barrel aged beer. In that respect, it falls short, as the adjuncts and texture are the real star of the show here. Very cool to try, but not worth the price of admission these days.""",4.52

23,Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout,"'its always an occasion to drink what is deemed on this website to be the best beer in the world. regardless of what one may think about how such rankings are figured, it is a treat to say the least. i remember when i was heady and westy 12 before that, times have changed! after a couple of narrowly missed opportunities to drink this one over the years, my man drlovemd87 came through in the clutch with this rarest of the rare bottle. my pour is as thick as paste, slick and black like crude oil, and without hardly any head to it, near still in appearance, shiny, almost gelatinous looking. the aroma and flavor are intense but unfortunately (to me) familiar, i wanted this to be strikingly different, at least from a quality standpoint, and as good as it all is, its not head and shoulders above all else, it might not even be my favorite barrel aged coffee stout i have had this year (shhh). a few things are immediately obvious to me. the first is that whatever barrels these were, they seem to have housed some excellent whiskey. its not more or less of it, nothing about the oak profile specifically, but the bourbon character itself seems obviously better than most of what else is out there, this i will grant. the second thing, is that saying something like this is objectively better than something else in its category that is notable and near perfect and all of that, is highly problematic, approximations and cloudy memories and nothing more than opinion. factually, this isnt that much better than any number of great beers in its field, and i will stand by that. i cant spend the whole time drinking this thinking about the merits of a ratings system i dont control or other beers i like better though, that would be a foolishly wasted opportunity to enjoy quite literally the best. its full of rich bourbon, heavy vanilla and maple syrup qualities, even the texture of maple syrup, tons of barrel char and earthy burnt dark grain and chocolate, and a well integrated high end coffee profile as well, in some ways quite simple, but impossibly mature and nuanced, enhanced magically by the whiskey, and with lingering sweet, bitter, raisin, cocoa, and bourbon character. its as good as they say it is, that is not my comment. my comment is that others are at this level too. i am enormously thankful to have been able to drink this one, especially without having to pay the absurd secondary market prices this is fetching. if you are considering dropping some coin for this on a forum or whatever, i would reconsider, not that this isnt awesome, but its likely that your local bottle shop or brewery has something comparable...'",4.55

Retention is above average, resilient, and leaves a small but thick layer of foam on top of the body. Initial lacing looks great. Body is a dark orange, hazy, with a few bubbles coming up. Looks really nice so far.', '', 'Nose is pretty classic for a hazy ipa, tropical. Mango, papaya, citrus rind, a little sweetness, but noticeably clean for the most part. Malty sweetness does a good job of smoothing things out here, but gets a little high at times. Smells quite good and generally pretty balanced.', '', 'Flavor is pretty full. The citrus and tropical notes are moderate and come out a little more as the beer warms. Malts come through more than one would think, a little sweet, which is fine, some hop bite, a little alcohol. On paper this doesn’t sound very good, but it works; it just drinks more like a malty west coast with some citrus and tropical notes, than it does an east coast haze bomb. In a way, this is way more balanced on all ends of the spectrum, and makes for a more enjoyable beer, just not what I would have expected. Solid brew though.', '', 'Mouthfeel also works. Carbonation is medium, maybe a hair below. Body has a good amount of thickness to it. Bitterness is not too wild, but asserts itself enough; this pairs well at times with the citrus tang. The appropriate amount of malty sugars do a nice job of blending everything together and smoothing this thing out. Solid mouthfeel that does a good amount of work here.', '', 'Drinkability is quite nice, this is pretty balanced and tasty enough to stay interesting.', '', 'Appearance turned out ok, the lacing was not very cohesive to say the least, nearly disappears entirely by the bottom of the glass. Still, the head was very impressive which helps save it.', '', 'Overall not really what I would come to expect from the hazy category, but that’s honestly a good thing. If you lightened up the malt bill just a hair and added some more effervescent hops this would really be a solid hybrid/go to for a style that has gotten way out of hand. As it stands, this is a solid beer that I would not mind revisiting.'",4.01
110,Heady Topper,"'Canned 8/7/20. At 53 degrees looks exactly like Focal Banger (FB) - opaque almost hazy deep gold with some clarity under huge rocky white head; cap retention is good; lacing is medium heavy, but seems a bit less in volume than FB. Strong catty, dank grapefruit and lemon nose, followed by onion and garlic which become more pronounced as liquid warms. Taste is very bitter grapefruit and lemon; less sweet malt base than FB; strong bitter citrus and onion finish. Same feel as FB, medium body, moderate carbonation, bitter (100 IBU) tongue coating with no hop astringency; no warmth from 8% abv. Overall, the onion and garlic in nose and on tongue takes away from my enjoyment of this beer; I like the long bitter citrus rind linger; bold, assertive flavors for sure...just some I personally don’t want; I like Focal Banger so much more; I’ll drink HT again, but I couldn’t drink two in a row...'",4.02

No, I wouldn\'t consider this to be a letdown but with so many other good beers out there, this didn\'t quite measure up to the hype for me. It was slick and enjoyable enough to warrant another go-around although no particular aspect about this was outstanding to me.

Above all, this particular bottle was a gift from the very person who introduced me to beer. It is a gesture that I took his invitation to heart, and have faithfully pursued the hobby well after we parted to different parts of the globe. And it is a mark of my respect for his patience in enduring my initial skepticism, callousness and thick-headedness when it came to drinking beer and taking notes. I owe him a great debt, and I honor that debt by drinking his beer.', '', 'I took great care and attached great ceremony to reviewing the Westvleteren. Ambient noise and smells were minimized.

It kicks up a light brown head, little to no lacing, and aside from a few flecks of yeast in the last droplets to fall from the bottle’s mouth, I have no physical evidence that this beer will be a milestone in my beer drinking career. That evidence appears in the aroma. I am stricken with childhood memories of happy Colorado Christmases, as an intoxicating blend of vanilla, oak, ribeye steaks, fig, and a touch of chocolate fill my nose. It is incredible, and it is here that I first get a taste of what all the praise, writing and hype is about. The Westy isn’t hype at all. It is credibly amazing, and deservedly loved. And the taste fits the Quad. style I’ve come to love so much. It is big and rich, barreling onto the tongue with the same aromatic flavors that caused me to reel in my chair. A few seconds later this boldness attenuates, exposing an undercurrent of fig and a deep, sweet red wine flavor. And then again, moments later this layer of flavor recedes to expose a tertiary layer of molasses, oak, smoked wood and a parmesan cheese like umami. To be short, there are three distinct layers of flavors, each of them characteristically delicious, and each a little quieter than the last. That final touch of umami savoriness is practically a whisper, but you can still make out the words.', '', 'With all these flavors in a single beer there is a very real threat that the flavors may become crowded and muddled. This is not the case. The Westvleteren 12 delivers these flavors in stages, and on a perfect palate. The beer is thick, but not syrupy, and it textures the flavors without warping them. It is a crowd of luminaries, each in perfect concordance with the others, a kind of harmony of brilliance without egos to interfere.', '', 'By the very end of the beer I am questioning whether this is actually a Quadrupel. It has all the basic qualities of a Belgian Strong Ale according to my taste buds, and possibly according to a rigid style guide. But I think the Belgian Strong Ale tag might be slightly too tight on a beer like this. The Westvletren is an expression of a style, and a permutation so fantastically brewed that it almost breaks from tradition. These breaks are sometimes called revolutions, which would be the highest form of irony for the Westy’s brewers who are steeped in tradition themselves. But they are also steeped in this beer, and they must know that what they do, they do very well. This level of brewing is intentional, and it shows. One need only look at the lines of avid drinkers banging on the monastery’s doors to understand that there must be some authentic draw to this beer. And now I finally realize it through a few intense sips. I’ve extended a dimension of my understanding of beer and the craft beer world with one bottle of a highly-esteemed brew.

To try any Westvleteren is a rite of passage. I have been visiting Westvleteren Abbey since the late eighties. Back then, you turned up on spec, no appointment or reservation needed, and loaded up. 10 crates was the max. If you are lucky, you can get two crates now. Or a take out pack of six, or two, from the cafe opposite the monastery gates. This is what hype has done. But also, has not. This beer is the same now as I remember it >30 years ago. No succumbing to fad or fashion. Now, a further, but very important point. Listen to the monks! Westvleteren is made to age. It really does get more surreal with months, even years on it, if stored cool. Yesterday I cracked open a bottle from my stash brewed in January 2019. For me, it has cream and ginger characteristics, and they were really getting a hold here and singing. For you - well, you decide. Even the taste evolution from the February release was interesting. Its texture, too, is like no other. You don't just taste it - you hear it. So. Drinking Westveleteren 12 (and 8 and 6 for that matter) is a ceremony.

On a more relevant note, this beer is best summed up by contrasting it to the beloved Street Fighter ZERO character Hibiki Dan.', '', 'So for those of you that aren’t millennials or were living under a rock when Street Fighter, Dan’s character was created as a parody of SNK’s King of Fighters franchise characters Ryo and Robert, who very suspiciously resembled Street Fighter’s two most recognizable characters, Ryu and Ken. Outside of having twisted mannerisms and catchphrases suspiciously resembling the two SNK characters that were ripping off Capcom characters that he was ripping off, Dan is kind of memorable for being all show and no power whatsoever; his super/EX combo finish, Shinkū Gadōken, for example, looks awfully similar to Ryū’s Shinkū Hadōken while doing 1/40th of the damage it does—many-a-times have I sat in front of the TV screen, thinking “oh shit I’m fucked” when I saw the screen suddenly turn red, orange, and yellow while CPU Dan caught me off guard with my HP at 30%, only to realize my character was still alive after being hit by ostentatious super combo.', '', 'Labored metaphors aside, BAIGCC is similar to Dan’s super finish in that it packs all the flavors it purports to deliver in one ginormous, sugar-spice-and-everything-nice upside your head, but then presenting a rapidly drying finish, which makes you feel stupid for cringing and bracing for impact—it’s hard to explain in close detail, but it’s like the opposite of getting a penicillin shot at the doctor’s, where you don’t feel the needle going in, but it feels like somebody injected the meaty part of your butt cheek with peanut butter for the rest of the day.', '⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀', 'A vacuum wave motion fist of toasted coconuts, wild sugar cane, rum cake, baker’s chocolate, intense caramelized sugar hits you square in the noggin, followed by a frosting-like sweetness. There’s a slight hint of hazelnuts that follow the gargantuan sweet super attack before all the flavors just simply drop off the side of the earth. Save for some residual flavors of hazelnuts and powdered sugar, your pixelated character brushes off the blow as if nothing happened and gets up ready to fight again—the fight against the glass is one of attrition after that initial “surprise”', '⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀', 'The mouthfeel is initially thick and sticky like raw cake batter, but it morphs into a more tolerable moist-ish soft texture with subsequent sips. The only way carbonation could make any impact on this beer is if it were effervescent to the level of a brut champagne; the intense brick wall of mouthfeel counteracts against any fleeting semblance of carbon dioxide on the tongue.'",4.45
630,Barrel Aged Imperial German Chocolate Cupcake Stout,"""Dark black with a pretty thin tan head. Smell is pure vanilla and coconut.

This beer requires sips about 1/4 the normal size. Then you can really experience it without having your senses being overloaded by the intensity.

Finally got to have the beer I have most coveted since I started visiting the enchanted beer mecca in 2013 and have proceeded to make the trek once a month since. All the trips finally paid off as it was there for on-site consumption. Had side by side with Le Sarrasin and Being and Time which might have thrown off the overall ranking. This was smooth as silk, fluffy clouds, extremely pleasant with where the base honey beer accentuated the wine barrel. The smell wasn't over powering, or super aromatic to me. A little bit of funk, don't know if that had to do with it being a 14. Once again the feel was the crazy thing to me and defintley stood out. It was super drinkable and if this was a beer I could have on a regular basis to have with dinner it would be amazing.

952,Zombie Dust,"'Thanks to wider distribution, finally able to taste this one and it was worth the wait. Pours a deep hazy golden yellow with strong head from minor agitation at standard pour angle into pint glass. Retains strong lacing. Very active carbonation only noticeable from an angle into light fixture. Good mouthfeel. A bit of froth with a crisp clean finish. Smells of pine, citrus, and malt biscuit. Not overpowering but very present. On the front palette lots of pine and grape fruit cleanly blending to malt biscuit and bread notes. Very well balanced. Mid-palette and back palette notes are very similar but accentuate based on taste bud position creating a perceived complexity but maintaining excellent balance throughout transition. This gives a very clean and well balanced overall feel to the entire tasting note and provides you with a very good ""full mouth"" drinking experience as well as when sipped. Totally brilliant in that way because this makes the tasting note extremely consistent, reliable, and full flavored. Probably the best balanced Pale Ale I\'ve ever had and I know people say ""this is an IPA"" but it\'s that very balance and the selecting flavor profile that it creates that makes this a very subtle and effective mix of flavors. There is not overwhelming pine or caramels like many IPAs, but a consistent flavor profile expressly only obtainable from the pale ale profile. Consistently we see pale ales preferred over IPAs because of this better balance and more subtle taste profile-- Zombie Dust simply perfects that and as a result reflects the possibility of having big taste in simple presentation. I had recently watched a pizza video (of all things) and it was noted by the pizzaiolo (who was an acclaimed master of the art of pizza making) that simple flavor profiles work best because it lets the consumer experience every piece of the taste profile both separately and then eventually as a whole creating balance with highlights of taste throughout. I think this reflects that same idea-- simple taste notes can be more pleasurable in their consistency and straight forward elements. So there you go-- very simple taste note, excellent taste experience. Finishes crisp and clean. Not too juicy. Not too bitter. Not too malty or sweet. Absolutely dead on right mix of all these things. Perfect balance. Lingering after taste of pine and malt. Again nothing overpowering. Truly a brilliant job and worth the wait.'",4.63

The look of the beer was a hazy orange with some very fruity and floral-smelling foam. My only complaint about the appearance is that a moderate pour still ended up with a lot of residue ending up in the beer, so there were white bits floating in the beer as I drank the entire thing - not the most appealing. The taste was really nice overall - definitely has some hop bite to it, mostly in the aftertaste. But it's not overpowering, and there's a lot of sweetness to balance it out. It's got a very tropical palate, and the feel is pretty rich, although a touch syrupy for my taste. I have to say, I was a little disappointed by this, but just because of how massively hyped it was.

Stored at home at 42 degrees and served at 55 degrees (as stated on the label) in a hand washed and dried Jester King snifter. Final temperature 60.9 degrees F.', 'Appearance – 3.', 'First pour – Medium brown, clear.', 'Body – Dark brown/black, opaque. When held to direct light, brown around the top edge.', 'Head – Average (Maximum two cm, aggressive center pour), tannish with large bubbles fizzing away, gone within a minute after the pour is completed, leaving thin complete ring of tiny bubbles, fed by aggressive effervescence.', 'Lacing – None, not unexpected at 20.3% ABV.', 'Aroma – 4 - Has an almost weak, watery dark fruit aroma with some weak wood and possibly bourbon in the background, but I must really horn it to pick up the bourbon.', 'Flavor – 4 – This begins somewhat sweet with weak flavors of “dark fruit’’ with raisins being weakly predominant and prunes trailing behind. Dates are weakly present. No alcohol (20.3% ABV as marked on label) aroma or flavor, but massive numbing of the tongue and soft palate occurs as it warms while being held in the mouth. No alcohol on the exhale, oddly enough. No diacetyl, no dimethylsulfide, no hops.', 'Palate – 4 – Medium, just short of syrupy, lively carbonation.', 'Final impression and summation: 4. Like the Chicxulub meteor, this burns all the way down my esophagus before striking my gastric mucosa, leaving a massive crater and wiping out all the helicobacter dinosaurs in my own, personal, mass extinction event. Otherwise, the flavors are subdued and blended to the point of making it difficult to separate individuals from the background salmagundi, providing a coherent and cogent synthesis of deep fruity flavors, sans wood or bourbon. Appearance is totally average: brown black, no head, but somehow looks less viscous than Old Engine Oil (of which I’ll soon be drinking sixers). Overall, a decent delivery system for high levels of alcohol. I capped the bottle while I can still make those decisions.'",3.94

I had a taste of another bottle in December, and it immediately reminded me of BCBS, but with some difference in character. It had a more pronounced dark fruit flavor. After 8 months of cold storage, I finally tried my bottle, and it immediately grabbed me with its strong, mellow flavors, and its similarity to BCBS.

Takes 3 days of dedicated effort to finish a bottle. I'm about half way through this one after 2 days. Seems to last quite well with fridge storage after opening, no doubt due to high ABV.

It had medium brown highlights throughout the whole pour. Forms in the glass dark, but even still with highlights around all edges. It formed a very thin and incomplete crown that was light tan in color. The smell is hot and boozy with big dark fruit notes like raisins, plums and figs. The taste comes in with those dark fruit notes again but now providing some cherry like element as well. It is definitely warm, but less than would ever be expected from a 40 proof bourbon barrel aged imperial stout. Finishes with that warmness mixing with some nice chocolate notes. Honestly though, I'm a little let down on the amount of flavor being delivered. Overall, this wasn't bad but I've definitely had better from the Bruery.

Aroma is roasted, toasted, and caramel malts with a swell of bourbon behind. Plum, toffee, and molasses give it a little extra boost. Aroma mellows as the beer warms, providing a kaleidoscope of dark stout flavors, with the alcohol receding into the background. Flavor profile is roasted, toasted, and caramel malts quickly followed by toffee, molasses, and bourbon. There is a boozy, heavy burn at the back fresh out of the fridge, but as it warms the bourbon turns to more of a warm liquid, as opposed to a molten express delivery of alcohol. The dense flavor profile covers up the near 20% ABV well, but the booze still peeks through, even after aging for a little over a year. Mouth feel is thick with a velvety, grainy texture.

First sip was all the raisins. Going back for more produced just a bunch of heat, whiskey, burnt caramel. I\'m getting some root beer, Hershey\'s syrup on the back end, and definitely coconut and marshmallow from the wood.

1768,Doppelganger,"'huge thanks to my brother for sharing this, its been on my list for a long time, and he shows up with it all nonchalant like its no big deal, ah the pleasures of living in the east where this stuff is at least within proximity! i was pumped to get into it, having been pretty high on a lot of the other hoppy beers these guys do, and was blown away by fresh alter ego in the past, which this is apparently a bigger version of. i do think these hops and this balance works just a little better in the lighter beer, but this is delicious stuff, whitewashed looking straw colored with a tall white creamy head from the can with great retention and foam mustache potential. the aroma and flavor bring a lot of ripe grapefruit, peachy stone fruit, and melon, its not quite tropical, but definitely not all citrus, a little mouthwatering passion fruit maybe too, a great combination of hops that doesnt fall off from the aroma to the flavor at all, a rarity in beers like this. i also like that it packs with it quite a bit of bitterness, so many of these are just dry hopped juicy things, but this still drinks like ipa, which i love. it has a frothy soft body, relative dryness, peppy carbonation, and a higher drinkability than it should for this strength and intensity of flavors. no hop bite or burn at all, and despite being really cloudy in the glass, this is very well refined beer. not as oh my god as alter ego was, but a hazy double ipa way ahead of the curve. worthy of its high praise, and a fun one to share with my brother. i wish i had access to more from these guys!'",4.3

At times, I thought that Keene Idea had climbed Mount Everest to be with Nelson. While overall it doesn't quite hit that stratospheric peak, Keene Idea is undoubtedly outstanding beer. The beer is not bitter, yet full of hoppiness and more. The tastes of orange, passionfruit, and guava are unashamedly fantastic, and that alcohol level does not cross the palate immediately, further making my pint dangerously drinkable. It's full bodied and very smooth, and already being such a great beer, felt that this beer was not playing fair."", '', ""Keene Idea is a beer that I'm sure made Dave Keene smile from ear to ear.

Usually I\'m ok with excessively wild wilds, etc. but the acidity for this version of BT (only one I\'ve tried), was off the charts for me - it didn\'t actually taste ""overly"" acidic; the taste was really pretty good, it was more the effect that the acidic component had on my stomach. I have read this in a couple other reviews so not sure if this is typical of all BTs, or if it was more isolated to this batch. Or maybe some more time in the bottle would have helped?

1999,The Broken Truck,"'for how hyped up this particular one is, it is nowhere near my favorite beer from de garde so far, and frankly nowhere near the objective best, if thats not nitpicking at this point (all of them being so fantastic). i love the story of this, but from the bottle, it didnt blow me away to the extent that some of their others have, especially some of the fruited ones. its really sour, more acidic than i remember most of them being, and that slows down drinkability a bit for sure, even with the amazing carbonation, soft round mouthfeel, and relative dryness to finish, its still just a slow sipper for me, which is probably how lambic should be anyway, but its sour enough to be harsh in the belly, and thats over the line for my preferences. perhaps this is a product of it being in the bottle too long, being a lambic type i was in no rush to open it, but not all of these age favorably apparently. the yeast profile under the acid is fantastic, musty bretty and funky, with distinct juicy fruitiness to it, white wine, apricots, even ripe pears, its rustic and interesting, but with the acid its pretty aggressive. the oak is sturdy here too, grounding and dense all the way through which i really like, it seems sort of oddly hoppy, like they definitely didnt use hops aged down to zero alpha acid, and if they did, there are some weird organic compounds in the mix here somehow. its got like a fruity linger in the finish i dont normally associate with the style. despite the developed brett and heavy wood, this doesnt seem as mature to me as i would have expected for something modeled on gueuze with the different vintages in the blend, less of the iodine medicinal character than the old world ones bring, and less of the hayloft agricultural harvest rustic character, this is almost too refined to fit that bill, not a criticism just a commentary. i think id like it more if the sourness were less, and dont get me wrong i still love it, but i would take a great many of their other beers before i took this one in a hypothetical draft of their best beers. always a treat to have their stuff though, and i can safely cross off this bucket list brew for now...', '', 'edit: this was leagues better the second time around for me, less acidity, a lot more nuance to the wild yeast profile, and with a fresh hoppy character to it at the end, tons of white wine, elderflower, and even white peach, its goegeous, and was a standout from a heavy session of amazing beers. not sure why it didnt taste like this the first time around, but i hve a raise a few scores to reflect how good it was this time. huge thanks to my buddy for sharing his bottle!'",4.46

The whole is greater than the sum of the parts. I love the color. Where I live, concord grapes rule, and I’m not a wine drinker (except for an occasional bottle or three of tawny port), so beer based on Merlot grapes are somewhat of a novelty.

2046,Saint Lamvinus,"'Pours a clear, deep, dark ruby red coloration with a small, fizzy head that fades to a thin ring around the glass almost instantly, with very slightly visible carbonation. Smell is quite dominated by a lovely tart red grape aroma, with milder notes of blue cheese funk and musty oak, as well as just a hint of red berries and mild tannins. Taste is an excellent balance of quite vibrant, slightly tart red grapes, some light blue cheese funk and a distinct, mildly tannic, musty oak presence, as well as subtle hints of red berries, lemon peel and balsamic vinegar. Finishes quite dry, with a light tartness and some red grapes and musty oak lingering in the aftertaste. Smooth, effervescent mouthfeel with a medium body and medium/strong carbonation.', '', 'While the sour and funky notes are a lot more subtle here than I expected, this really makes up for that with an absolutely sublime balance of vibrant fruit character, strong oak presence and funky highlights, while also displaying quite a dry body rounded out by a light sweetness. The red grape and berry notes, as well as mildly tannic, musty oak lends a certain vinous quality to this that is quite pleasant and also enrichens this with a certain depth, while still remaining quite refreshing and easily drinkable at the same time. A superb Lambic overall, that is perhaps not quite as rich and complex as other examples of the style, but makes up for that with a subtle, nuanced balance that is absolutely sublime.'",4.52

It's tart, dry (not as dry as many of their other fruit lambics), mildly sour with just a slight oak mustiness and notes of fresh grapes skins. While it is an overall dry lambic, there is some sweetness from the grapes that balances out the tartness. It has a medium bodied mouthfeel with just mild acidity, not too harsh. Overall, one of the better Cantillon's I've tried. It really stands out for being well balanced. While it used Merlot grapes, I wouldn't describe the beer having a taste resembling the qualities of Merlot (leathery and dark fruits), however this is a 2014 bottle and it may differ from a fresher version.

2102,Triple Shot,"'this stuff is divine, and in such an unassuming package too, crazy! thanks to my brother for sourcing this rarity, thought i might never get to taste this one. its a treat too, so much coffee, enough so even that is stands out as way more than the vanilla bean double shit, which we enjoyed right before this one. its almost gritty and bitter in comparison, but the vanilla sure did a lot to sweeten that up and round it out. here we have a truer expression of the coffee, more isolated in a way, and i love how robust it is, almost as much coffee as it is beer, although i do get a little booziness poking through this one in the aroma. the coffee has deep chocolate tones to it, a little spiciness even, a rigid sort of bitterness mid palate, and a real richness as well, notes of molasses and maple work in from the grain here, and there is a neat almost amaretto layer. maybe not quite as complex as the double shot was to me, a little more straight forward from the grain, but i love the way the coffee manifests itself in here, about as forward as i have known it to be in any beer, and lingering forever on the palate after each slow sip. this is the ultimate coffee beer really, and the freshness of the coffee really stands out as well, especially for something that was bottle many months before we opened it. it was wonderful to finally get to drink some of these hard to get tree house stouts, thanks to my brother! these were unforgettable!'",4.5

Espresso bean, raspberry slickness, boozy brandy, brown sugar, and booze (!) emerged on the palate once this fully warmed up. Sure, this packed a punch but it was so smooth and sweet that it was like the softest boxing gloves were put on before the blow was delivered.

Amazing balance of super rich malts, coconut, vanilla, and bourbon barrel presence/integrations; solid earthy hops and restrained fruity yeast.

I think age has actually smoothed this out a bit -cooling off the heat and smoothing out the bite.

Aromas of big raisin, plum, prune, cherry, fig, date, apricot, berries, red grape, port, sherry, rum, brandy, cognac, bourbon, coconut, toasted oak, honey, caramel, maple syrup, brown sugar, toffee, vanilla, biscuit, roasted nuts, and brown bread/crust; with lighter notes of licorice, molasses, chocolate, cocoa, oak char, leather, tobacco, cinnamon, peppercorn, and yeast/oak/toasted earthiness. Increasing booze in the aromas, but not too overwhelming. Damn nice aromas with great balance and complexity of dark/bready/light roasted malts, fruity yeast, and multiple barrel notes; with great strength.

Amazing complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/bready/light roasted malts, fruity yeast, and multiple barrel flavors; with a great malt/oak spiciness balance, and no cloying sweetness after the finish. Lightly increasing dryness from lingering barrel tannin and spicy alcohol. Fairly full body; with a smooth, creamy/slick, and lightly syrupy/tannic mouthfeel that is fantastic. Light-moderate increasing warmth of 28%, some lingering barrel booze after the finish; but not overwhelming. Overall this is an amazing barrel aged strong ale! All around incredible complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/bready/light roasted malts, fruity yeast, and multiple barrel flavors; very smooth and dangerously easy to sip on slowly for the enormous ABV.

No legs.', 'Head – Large (Maximum four cm, aggressive center pour), tannish with large bubbles nosily popping, gone within a minute after the pour is completed, leaving thin partial ring of tiny bubbles, fed by effervescence.

The appearance in unremarkable, looking like any headless imperial stout. The aroma is most like Flying Dog’s Raison D’Etre, at least to my burnt-out lab nose. In the flavor I find no hint of hazelnuts, oak, or bourbon, just a generic sweetness with a hint of DARK FRUIT, something I didn’t taste (other than raisins) until I was typing this summary.

The taste was excellent, and surprised me with its drink-ability. Well balanced malty goodness and just enough hop presence to balance out the sweet. Viscous mouth feel, I didn't discern the peppers until the third sip, and then they didn't leave. They made their presence known at the back of the tongue in a way I still cannot define, but it had to be them. Just this intriguing edge to the smoothness everywhere else. I have to rate this highly because the skill necessary to craft a beer with peppers and not have those peppers be more than a subtle edge impresses me.

Melon, white grape, and a bit of woodsy dankness could be felt in the taste as this almost felt barrel-aged but was just a result of the Nelson coming through.

What a great time to be a beer drinker and an even better time to be other half. Not thier best offering but good luck to anyone trying to pull off a beer of this magnitude with this quality.

3417,4th Anniversary,"""A: Straw yellow mixed with burnt orange falling somewhere in the realm of pale gold. Does QDH = more haze? This is about as turbid as their DDH offerings, so I'm guessing not. Fortunately doesn't venture into that super murky, bordering on gross muddy water territory that some breweries' liquid seems to express. Thin half finger of head dissipates quickly."", '', ""S: Fruit cocktail! Pineapple/nectarine/blueberry juice with a splash of booze. Pungent and sticky, like a peach that's been left on the counter for too long. Hints of green/dank/herb, but the fruitiness is the star. Lite signature OH nuttiness, but I'm getting more scallion and candied pine than the usual nuttiness. Feels like Mosaic is leading the way, but I can tell there's some adjunct malt in there keeping it soft."", '', ""T: Now that's outstanding. Wheat and oats come through big time to assist the hops in their delivery of an onslaught of overripe-pushing-toward-candied fruit flavors. Caramelized pineapple leads the way along with variegated waves of citrus. Sweet Meyer lemon and tangerine and grapefruit. Blueberry juice concentrate. Little bit of pine and some peanut skin bitterness close it out, along with the most mild ethanol flavor to help dry out all that sweetness. As with the nose, the hint of booze really gives this a fruit cocktail kinda vibe, and there's even less dank/savory on the taste to remind you that this is, in fact, made from just four ingredients."", '', 'M: 10%, you say? OH makes 8.5% DIPAs hotter than this. Drinkability is remarkably showcased here. Sweetness and bitterness are both dialed way up, but they keep each other in check so you barely notice how wonderfully extreme they are. Body is medium, which may be my only gripe with this beer... At 10%, I\'d like some more heft to my beers, whether it be carbonation or weight or something to just coat the mouth and do the intensity of flavor justice. Again, it seems they were going for creating the most ""drinkable"" TIPA, as I have had fuller takes on the style from them (DDH AGE, for one). But I really can\'t stress how impressively they\'ve concealed the alcohol on this one, especially given how fresh it is. Save for that mild ethanol flavor and a moderate dryness on the finish, I\'d have a hard time pinning this one above 8.5-9.0%.', '', 'O: It\'s been a pleasure to see OH evolve over the years, especially in their execution of triple IPAs. All Green Everything was the first beer I had from them, and it awoke my senses (literally) to what beer could be. Since then, they\'ve changed quite a bit, and most recently, seem to have really dialed in their execution of the NE style. This beer feels like an expression of that maturation. Despite its ABV, it\'s not as extreme as their earlier attempts, avoiding all of the pitfalls of palate fatigue and ""imbalance"" (ugh) that they struggled with in the past. It\'s big and bold and hopped out the wazoo, but it feels tighter and more carefully considered in the details. I\'ll let the use of ""QDH"" slide this time out of respect for the anniversary, but marketing fluff aside, this beer is truly well done and worthy of representing a great brewery\'s fourth rotation around the sun!'",4.77

Highly polished, highly reflective, mesmerising to stare at glowing ruby gemstone red - clear, but not crystal. A finger of quick, loose, just-slightly-pink head builds up, and then quickly reduces to a thin soapy collar. Some slow effervescence can be seen."", '', ""Nose: There are average cherry wild ales, and there are cherry wild ales that you can just tell are something incredible by the aroma. This is in the latter category. The amount of cherry on the nose is borderline unreal and saturated, while being entirely organic in nature. Not only is this a cherry bomb aroma, but what is really impressive is how both the Montmorency AND the Balaton cherries seem to translate. There is some intensely sweet, ripe, juicy Balaton character, lending an almost maraschino cherry on top of a maraschino liqueur note, bursting with big, deep, dark cherry juice, while the Montmorency cherries lend that floral, fresh, tangy cherry note, with a touch of stem, pit, and even cherry blossom. There is also a healthy amount of oak, and, along with the cherries, seems to lend this subtle cinnamon spice note, with just a whisper of oaky vanillins. There is a suggestion of acidity, but it doesn't singe the nose when inhaling, and there's very little earthy or barnyard funk. Just some wet oak, leather, old parchment, dusty attic, and a hint of brett. The cherries obscure any real serious funk or acidity that may lie beneath. There's a touch of gently toasty grain beneath everything, which is the icing on the cake."", '', ""Palate: First thing, from the very first sip, it isn't bracing sourness that hits, it isn't tannic oak, it isn't malt, it's sweet and tart ripe cherry flesh. The deep, bold Balaton sweetness greets the palate, giving up its sweet juicy goodness, while never coming across as artificial, cough syrupy, sticky, or overly sweet. This sweet cherry juice flavour unfurls to eventually reveal the Montmorency character beneath. The Montmorency is not quite as deep, bold, and saturated with juicy sweetness, but it provides a slightly less ripe, slightly fruitier character, that brings Japanese cherry blossom, a bit of plum, a hint of cherry potpourri, cinnamon/amburana wood spice, and a bright, natural, almost slightly unripe cherry tartness to the table. In addition to this subtle fruity tartness, the acidity lends a near-perfect degree of sour. It really isn't bracing, puckering, or blinding in any way. Make no mistake, this is a sour ale, no question about it, but it isn't Midwest sour. There is some lemony lacto pucker, a bit less of some acetic pedio bite, and a bit more of some tart, funky, mineralic brett, lending not quite salinity, and definitely not sweat, but that classic restrained brett tang, along with some musty wet wood, a little hint of bandaid, and that classic bretty stone fruit pit note. The high degree of minerality paired with the bandaid note and the deep cherry really gives this a little hint of a Kriek vibe. The tartness has a quick downward curve, allowing some really wonderful oak to appear before the finish, paired with a hint of vanilla, a hint of baking spice, a hint of caramel, and a hint of brown sugar. The sourness takes a far back seat, revealing some more dusty brett, and then finally, the ever-so-slightly sweet toasted grain base reveals itself, with a wonderful melding of grainy wheat and round malty barley, cereal grains, essence of cherry, and gently tannic oak linger on and conclude the finish."", '', ""Mouthfeel/Body: MvB is light, crisp, and snappy by nature, though the mild to moderate cherry sweetness and slight bit of malt body push this a bit closer to medium-bodied territory. Effervescence is surprisingly low. It isn't flat, but rather lazy and slow. One might expect this to be a super fizzy, champagne-like experience, but that is not the case, which also contributes to a slightly fuller feel. Soft, round, and even quite juicy upfront, the ale is not scrubbing, and even feels somewhat smooth. The oak in the finish provides some tannicdrying as the sweetness fades, but the ale itself isn't tannic or ultra-dry."", '', 'Overall: This is a really remarkable cherry wild ale, and an absolute triumph from Jester King. The perceivable differences between the Montmorency and Balaton cherries is a work of art, and the structure, balance, and progression of the ale is nothing short of impressive. The acidity is forward, but kept in check, the sweetness makes a statement up front, and then takes a supporting role, the oak and microflora influence walks a tightrope right down the middle of balanced, and the subtle malty, grainy base beneath it all is something that I always look for, but rarely get in highly acidic ales. This is just absolutely world class.'",4.44

Maintained excellent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, wood, dark chocolate, vanilla, sweet alcohol, and roasted malt. The flavor was of sweet malt, roasted malt, dark chocolate, vanilla, wood, sweet alcohol, and milk chocolate. It had a heavy feel on the palate with medium carbonation. Overall this was an excellent brew. This was another one that I was shocked to see come out at the birthday party. This was sampled directly after Stormaktsporter. There was a pretty good difference in this one from the base brew. There was a lot more presence of the vanilla with an addition of various chocolate aspects. The cigar aspect I picked up on in the base brew had disappeared, but what replaced it in both the flavor and aroma was just plain excellent.

I’ve been on a hazy DIPA kick this summer, so a lot of them blend together but this one definitely has some unique notes coming through. The description by Trillium says pink starburst, and I’m definitely getting some of that- really candy like fruity flavor. I’m also getting some bitter citrus and sweet tropical fruits. Lingering bitterness from hop oils on the palate. I have to say this one sneaks up on you at 9+% because you don’t even notice it. So many beers at that level have a very obvious alcohol burn and taste but this one is totally smooth for that ABV.

The aroma is completely saturated, sweet, and fruity, and bears no earthy, musty, or funky components.', '', ""Palate: The beer greets the palate with a forceful, sugary sweetness, which is to be expected from a dry-hopped beer of this calibre. It isn't a starchy, malty sweetness, but rather a concentrated fructose sweetness, like ripe tropical fruit. Speaking of ripe tropical fruit, the flavour is bursting with ripe mango, pineapple, papaya, and overripe peach, the latter being very indicative of the Galaxy hops that are crammed into this. There are some bright, juicy, slightly acidic notes of orange juice and grapefruit, which highly compliment the pineapple notes, and also help to cut through some of the sweetness. Much of this acidity is presumably hop burn, though it's restrained enough to be enjoyable, adding a layer of complexity rather than being detrimental to the beer itself. There is just a touch of earthy dankness which is also to be expected from a bill containing any amount of Galaxy. I suspect the grist contains a measurable amount of oat, as the malt is clean, fairly neutral, and possesses practically zero graininess. The finish is quite fruity and floral, before the sweetness gently subsides, allowing just a touch of resinous bitterness to peek through at the very end, before lifting off, leaving a clean, oaty dryness and a whisper of peach lingering."", '', ""Mouthfeel/Body: It's a big, bold, dry hopped New England double IPA clocking in at 9.3% ABV, AND it's from Trillium. Anyone who has had a big Trillium IPA can imaging that this beer is just one massively fluffy hoppy pillow. The beer is soft, fluffy, creamy, and velvety smooth, yet still possesses enough effervescence to lend texture and cut through some of the heft. Nevertheless, this is a very stout beer, and is by no means a midday summer refresher. While the flavour profile would allow this to pair nicely with food, I think the sheer weight of it may prevent it from being the ideal mean accompaniment. Also bear in mind that aside from the heft of this beer, it shows little-to-no evidence of it's ABV, which could make this a dangerous little creeper."", '', ""Overall: For what this beer is, it's hard to find much, if anything wrong with it.

Actually a very similar experience to Big Bird, which I lucked into two years ago as I picked up a flat of Trillium beers in Fort Point on our way to Cape Cod for a bi-annual multi-family trip. I think this one is actually more polished and tasty, fresh, than Big Bird was. But the amazing hop experience is similar. Looks like a muddy pineapple juice, but the aromas and (to a just slightly lesser degree) flavors cover just about every hop-related note I love about hoppy beers. Citrus, pith, berries, mango, musky wine grapes, dank hemp, tropical fruit, wheat biscuit, sugared grapefruit. Absolutely phenomenal. Grassy, but not overly so, which is a nice departure from most NE IPAs. Really nice level of sweetness, as well, and zero green astringency, even fresh, which distances this beer from Big Bird.

3793,Abt 12,"""The experience begins with a pour from 25+ oz. brown cork topped bottle into a clear pint glass. A cork stopped beer, so this must be special. The posted 10% ABV is dully noted. It's a beautiful result. The beer is a bright brown with substantial biege head atop. Much less yeasty to the nose than many Belgian Quads. Instead, it's a nice harmony of malts and hops, with a hint of the yeast. Next visual notice is only a little lace follows as the head ebbs. World Class is the appropriate designation for the taste. Remarkably light for its richness and incredibly balanced between the big three; yeast, malt and hops. The alcohol contributes to the taste as well, but only as a typical five percenter, not something double that. If the often overpowering yeastiness of Belgians is offsetting, this is for you.

This is going to be interesting. Let's begin."", 'Upon greeting the palate, the ale carries a mild malt sweetness, with an absolute ton of maltiness. Fresh baked still soft dark bread, rum-soaked fruit cake, and cola emerge, peppered with dark spiced rum notes. An explosion of dark fruit reveals notes of prune, fermented cherry, dates, raisin, and fig. Along with these dark fruit notes comes a character I generally only find in red wine cask-aged ales - fruity, yet dry wine grape/red berry notes, with the typical fermented wine flair. This actually shifts along with the dark fruit notes to become fairly earthy, and extremely similar to the port note in a port cask-aged imperial stout. Some subtle European hop spice and earthiness pair up with this wine-like character, and the initial malt sweetness begins to fade to the background, followed closely behind by much of the dark fruit notes. Into the finish, it becomes earthy and spicy, with the earthiness coming primarily from hops, but some of that tawny port note still lingers. At this point - well into the finish - the flavour takes a turn, and it suddenly takes on the characteristics of a traditional German amber/dark lager. The caramelised bread notes, the subtle spicy hopes, and most of all, the yeast flavour takes on a lager-esqu flavour, complete with the very subtle metallic note. The cola, spice, sweetness, malt, dark fruit, and earthiness fade away, and the ale concludes with the aftertaste of European hops and a whisper of dark bread.', '', ""Mouthfeel/Body: The body is rather unique, because it's both rich and crisp at the same time. It greets the palate medium-bodied, with a very tight crispness about it. Soon after, the maltiness lends a big, soft, not-quite-chewy richness to it, pushing it close to full-bodied territory, but constantly remains balanced by a very lively fizzy effervescence. It's wet, soft, and even a bit slick upfront, but as it finishes, it dries out and becomes fairly crisp once again. There are stages where the ale is crisp, medium, and full-bodied, but it's a harmonious transition, and in the end, I would put this in the medium-bodied category. Slight acidity in the first half of the beer, which is slowly extinguished by the malt. Semi-dry finish with mild drying properties, and some slight hop resin cling. Becomes sticky around the lips. Very mild alcohol warmth from the back of the throat to below the sternum, from its 10% ABV, and fluid nature."", '', ""Overall: This is a truly fine example of nuance, and does not strike me an an ale that is easy to properly brew. There is a lot going on in here, but it's never loud or abrasive. It's soft, friendly, and comforting, offering a warm, gentle embrace, and a velvet caress.

This misconception usually results in me doing something stupid like buying multiple four packs of the same beer thinking that the hot weather will help me power through the beers, and make them feel enjoyable all at the same time, while completely discounting such variables as (1) the fact that the human appetite decreases during warmer seasons; (2) my taste buds seem to get burned out from hops a lot faster in the summer; and, (3) regardless of the season, I’m usually too tired to drink a large quantity of beer after work, so I tend to reach for the higher ABV beers than the lower.', '', 'So until those three variables are somehow resolved internally, I usually find myself doing the exact opposite of what I think I would normally be doing in terms of drinking during the Summer months: instead of crushing session IPAs, wheat beers, and bretty saisons, I end up fruitlessly trying to solodome bombers of BA stouts and passing out with over half the beer still left in the glass; or drinking one 12oz bottle of a high ABV stout and trying to start another lower ABV IPA and then passing out with over three-fourth of the beer still left in the glass; or actually finishing two tall boys of an IPA, going to bed at like 12:30 AM and waking up tired and hungover.', '', 'My idiosyncratic drinking habits formed from my highly functional alcoholism aside, it seems like a single 16oz can of a moderately high ABV stout is usually right around my happy spot of where I want to be when I’m too tired to do anything productive yet not tired enough to go to sleep—lucky for me my favorite brewery has made the ingenious decision of canning their most famous beer in tall boy format; unlucky for me, it’s so rich it’s almost taken me 5 weeks to finish a four-pack by myself.', '', 'When I heard that Mikerphone and Great Notion were brewing beers together, I was kind of hoping that their love child would be a cross between Smells Like Bean Spirit and Double Stack, kind of like what EvilTwin did with Westbrook with Imperial Biscotti Mexican Cake Break, but with less spice and more maple. And much less sticky cloying sweetness toward the back. I think they ended up putting out some strawberry IPA which I didn’t try because well, strawberry and IPA are not two words I ever want to see in the same sentence, as well as an imperial stout with peanut butter and marshmallows because I think the bottles were only put out in Chicago, and it was only briefly on tap if ever.', '⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀', 'If you haven’t gotten the hint by me wasting all this comment space while writing absolutely nothing about the actual beer itself, it’s because there’s nothing really to write about this beer: it’s coffee, maple syrup, pancake batter, and done. For posterity’s sake, I will go on record and point out that the beer also contains minor notes of whole grain pancakes which contains half-assedly molten dark cacao chocolate chips, but maple and coffee definitely are the two incredibly bold takeaways from this beer, and for anyone to miss it they’d have to absolutely no functional smell and taste receptors in their body at all.', '⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀', 'Compared to previous batches however, the body has become a lot more enjoyable, and by that I mean that it feels less like syrup and more like 99% humidity while being 102 outside on your skin/tongue.

Neither the maple nor the coffee is as strong as you would expect from the nose, and the base beer is not tasty enough to back them up. Some bitterness comes through, but it's almost burnt-tasting, not sure if that's from the malts or the coffee. Feel is not great. Not really very thick for an 11% stout, and it's a little over-carbed too. Overall, a fairly good beer, but disappointing.

It was like dunking a syrup drenched pancake into a stout, then pouring the rest of the glass into the leftover syrup on the plate and tossing some coffee grinds in it. The roasty aspects and slight bitterness of the coffee dial down the sweetness to a reasonable level, but you'd better love maple syrup to drink this. The chocolate, roasted malts, burnt coffee, molasses and buttery notes from the aroma are also present in the flavor. This is craft beer at it's finest, as it's the total opposite of a macro brewed lager and yet made so well that it's delicious while hiding the 11% ABV masterfully.

I am a huge fan of maple flavoring, and thankfully, the maple out weights the coffee by a long shot. On tap, I really enjoyed the beer; from the can, this beer is amazing. For 11 percent, this beer is the definition of a lethal weapon. Chocked full of sweet maple flavor and subtle milk chocolate with a malty finish. From the can, the beer tastes much more balanced and places a greater emphasis on maple syrup and other flavors than what I experienced on tap. I disagree with those that say it is unnatural tasting- its tastes natural, just with an abundance and overload of natural flavors than could be perceived as overwhelming. This beer is fucking great.

Coffee, roasted malt, and (of course) dark chocolate all offer a nice ballast to the coconut. One niggle: the additions are so bold, they overpower the porter backbone somewhat. This beer is a total showstopper on the taste buds...well, at least for the first few sips. Apart from a slightly roasted opening, coconut utterly dominates in the best/worst way around the middle and end. Coffee plays second fiddle to the coconut flavors, just like the aroma indicated. Speaking of how it ends, the finish comes across like this coconut coffee porter had three tons of table sugar clumsily added to it - there\'s that ""so sweet, it\'s somehow bitter"" sensation I get from a select few dessert beers (like Creme Brulee from Southern Tier...or Maple Bacon Coffee Porter from Funky Buddha themselves!) At the end of the day, the actual flavor of this beer is a total letdown next to the awesome nose. Plus, it feels thin and angular - not a good combination with the extreme levels of sweetness. Said extreme sweetness ultimately chokes the drinkability factor. Carbonation is medium high. I do enjoy this more than their Maple Bacon Coffee Porter, but eh.

4321,Apple Brandy Barrel Noir,"'A beer that lives up to the reputation. I’ll get to the appearance at the end of the review, mostly because the smell and taste are the two most important parts of this beer and for one other reason. Smell is boozy barrel up front with a healthy amount of warm apple to round it out. Taste is more balanced, with the apple slightly leading the way and the boozy oaky barrel subtly surrounding it. Feel is medium bodied, neither oily nor thick-a perfect example of “just right”. Mouth watering, drinks more like a non-barrel aged 9 or 10% abv than a big bold 12.', '', 'My only problem, however, was evident right off the open and pour. I opened it and got hit with the apple and brandy before the cap came off, but I didn’t hear the usual noise one expects opening a beer, because the one I had had little to no carbonation. It has a nice dark hue with some brown edging, but there was no foam and very little lacing. If they date their beer with the first three numbers being the date, this was bottled 9/26/18. Doing a little online research, in October of last year, there was a release by Prairie that some of this beer was infected, so I don’t know if that’s the case here. But if this beer infected just means the loss of carbonation, I’d take an infected version of it over a lot of other beers out there. Because this is phenomenal! Long time want, glad I got it.'",4.76

This has a bottle date of 5/22/2019. Poured out of a 12/68 oz. bottle into one of my tulip glasses, this beer pours a pretty clear, fairly light/pale golden color with lots of streams of little bubbles rapidly and continually rising to the beer's surface. Has a very carbonated looking, white head that's about an inch thick when first poured that eventually settles to a thick, creamy looking, layer of surface foam along with a very thick ring of foam surrounding the inside of the glass. Good lacing here too. Aromas of some bready malts, yeasty esters, and Chardonnay oak along with some Brettanomyces funk notes that's all rounded out with just a hint of lactose. Flavor wise, this starts out with some bready malt that gives way to oaked Chardonnay white wine grape that has a nice tartness upfront that gives way to some yeasty funk and sourness, both from the grape and also from what seems to be some lactose as well as far as my tastebuds are concerned. All the flavors are balanced and compliment each other superbly. WOW!!! Has fairly crisp, also smooth, dry mouthfeel with moderate carbonation.

It's whiskey forward at first, but quickly mellows, and lacks that oak or charred wood complexity on the finish. Alcohol presence is minimal, but that 14.5% will hit you before you finish. Mouthfeel is slick; each sip quickly subsides, leaving a coconut-meets-brown-sugar residue reminiscent of a cookie or granola bar. All in all it's a great beer, and real treat.

I have felt like the pepper quality has already been muted. And because it's only 11.2%? The regular is 13% and pirate bomb is 15%? What's the difference here? Let's see. Pouring from a 12 oz. bottle into a tulip glass. This beer pours out looking like dark chocolate in color and forms a very thin caramel crown that disippated before I even got a picture. The first thing I notice on the smell is a ton of dark fruit. Raisins and plums dance around while introducing you to some barrel notes in the form of a dry oak smell. Very good smell but I'm not getting too much from the nose in the way of the regular bomb! So we'll see what the tastes brings. From the first sip the chocolate kicks through the curtain and steals the floor, while the dark fruit are supporting from behind. As far as the chili peppers, it's about what I expected. You wouldn't even know they're in the beer. I wish the coffee and vanilla were showing up a little more as well, but I do have to say that this is greatly balanced as far as the whiskey and barrel being present but not overpowering. The mouthfeel is thick and fudge like. It coats the mouth all the way through while providing a slight and well balanced warming sensation. Overall, this was a very good treat and I'm glad to have another crack at it. But it's pretty much what I remember from the first time. It's very good, but not great.

I wish that the lacing would have persisted longer, but I did really enjoy the appearance of the liquid itself. Smells incredible, deep dark roast coffee, dark chocolate, vanilla, caramel, brown sugar, malt, toasted nuts and a little cinnamon. I really couldn’t detect chili peppers in the aromas. Taste follows the nose, great balance, depth and complexity. At the finish there was a very mild note of chili peppers, although without any corresponding heat. This was a sipper of a beer, but the high ABV was still fairly well hidden and this paired well with both savory dinner and sweet dessert. Coffee was neither acidic nor sour, and was actually very well done considering other coffee stouts tend to go crazy on the coffee infusion. This one had just the right amount of reserve.

5070,Coffee Abraxas,"'Pours black and after a very moderate intensity pour, nets near zero head. What head is there comes via a ring of khaki foam that lingers a long while. Aroma is huge, hitting all the notes of the base beer - cinnamon, cardamon, nutmeg, chilies and other spices. Dark chocolate and cocoa powder add a little dry sweetness. Medium-bodied, dark coffee is interwoven throughout the structure of the nose, never taking the limelight, instead subtly reminding the palate it\'s there. Roasty, toasty malts add firm and dark support, but are an afterthought to the additive flavors. Flavor profile is deep notes of mingling cardamon, nutmeg, ancho (mild) chilies and cinnamon with medium-bodied, dark coffee, and roasty malts up front. Medium-bodied coffee hits center stage for a brief glimpse between spices and malts, and then returns to lingering and observing from aside the curtain. While spices eagerly welcome each sip like a used car salesman do for a visitor to the lot, they quickly fade to show the frame work of this beer - roasty, toasty, nutty malts - in other words, robust and dark. Between the dynamics of spices, coffee, and malts, there are flashes of chocolate, cocoa powder, and molasses. Very dynamic despite a slightly heavy hand on the spices. Perhaps more so than any other beer I\'ve had, serving temperature is critical here. Too cold and the spices come off heavy, but as the beer warms a touch, the spices meld into the dark malt backdrop, forming a sublime experience. As this beer nears the 50F mark, it develops a sublime balance. Mouth feel is medium-thick, with a smooth, creamy texture that develops a fairly still texture when served directly out of the fridge. As the beer warms, it develops a more grainy, velvety texture, enhancing the experience. Overall, the headline here is ""ABRAXAS"", with the subtitle being ""enters a non-mutually exclusive relationship with coffee"". Coffee is present, particularly as the beer warms, but never steps into the limelight for more than a brief second or two.

Touch of booze in the aromas as it warmed, but not overwhelming. Damn nice aromas with great balance and complexity of dark/roast/bready malt, walnuts, spices, and bourbon barrel notes; with great strength.

Amazing complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/roast/bready malt, walnuts, spices, and bourbon barrel flavors; with a great roasted bitter/sweet and spiciness balance; with no cloying/acrid/astringent flavors after the finish.

Light-medium carbonation and fairly full body; with a very smooth, creamy/silky/velvety, and lightly sticky/chalky/tannic mouthfeel that is fantastic. Mildly increasing warmth of 12.1% and pepper heat; with minimal barrel booziness lingering after the finish. Overall this is an amazing barrel aged imperial spiced stout! All around incredible complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/roast/bready malt, walnuts, spices, and bourbon barrel flavors; very smooth and dangerously easy to sip on for the big ABV, with the mildly bitter/spicy/drying finish.

The aroma is resinous, citrusy, and otherwise fruity (apples, berries, dried apricot) over a biscuity and bready malt base.

Additionally, I like that the malt comes through as I've been finding a lot of beers lately that only display the hops. On to the taste... I think the aroma sets it up real well. So, to repeat, I'm finding a nicely blended mix of firm malt that's gently biscuity and bready with notes of hop resins, soft citrus, peach, apple and sweet berries, and subtle mango. A very firm bitterness anchors it from start to finish, and then dries it quite readily. It finishes medium-long with the hoppy fruitiness fading first, followed by some residual malt, and then earthy and leafy/herbal hops the linger the longest. Bitterness then trails for even longer. It has a mouth coating medium-full body with a standard carbonation that gently bristles but then warms to become smoother wrapped in the malt that's there. Overall it's really quite nice.
